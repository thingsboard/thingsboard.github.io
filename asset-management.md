            <h2>Processes Behind Assets Management Software</h2>
            <div class="text-content medium-margin">Digital assets management system (DAM) is usually referenced by customers as "enterprise asset management" or "asset performance management" systems. This term means an IT asset management software, a platform, a tool, or an app that enables the following usage scenarios in various industries:</div>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><span class="bold-text">real-time-location tracking;</span></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">asset usage/utilization tracking;</span></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">asset health monitoring;</span></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">conditions monitoring;</span></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">remaining useful life (RUL);</span></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">predictive maintenance;</span></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">integration with ERP/CRM;</span></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">alerting and notifications.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="text-content small-margin">At the core of digital asset management software lies the ability to gather data from a variety of sources, such as sensors, RFID tags, and manual input. The software acts as a central repository for this information, ensuring it's easily accessible and up-to-date. Once the data is collected, the assets management system employs advanced analytics to generate actionable insights.</div>
            <div class="text-content small-margin">
            Seamless integration with ERP, CRM, and other business systems is crucial for IoT asset monitoring. This ensures that information about physical assets is readily available within the broader context of organizational operations.</div>
            <div class="text-content small-margin">
            The principles of DAM are the fundamental values and guidelines that govern the design and operation of the asset tracking software. They are obtained from the best practices and standards, such as ISO 55000, PAS 55, or IAM.</div>
