							<p>We were struggling trying to implement our own IOT infrastructure when
								Thingsboard suddenly appeared. Immediately we started testing and were
								amazed with the feature completeness, stability and ease of use of this
								great platform, although it was only in version 1.0 and had been
								released just days prior.</p>
							<br/><br/>
							<p>Our business needed some special features on the frontend and some major
								modifications on the backend but after exchanging a few emails it was
								clear that Thingsboard was the way to go. The necessary changes were
								implemented in a matter of a few weeks and the quality and thoroughness
								of the implementation far exceed our expectations. I've been working
								with OSS since the mid 1990s and know of it's many benefits but the
								quality of Thingsboard as well as the speed of development continues to
								impress me.</p>

							<p>Thingsboard is the new kid on the (IoT PaaS) block. Its designed by developers for developers
								with emphasis to end-customers, with promising features that do not existing on other open source
								IoT platforms yet. It's build on proven, no-bullshit enterprise open source technologies and has
								progressed very fast since it's public launch thanks to its committed kick-ass senior dev team.</p>
							<br/><br/>
							<p>In my company, we are currently merging our current LoRaWAN and Big Data Analytics solutions
								with Thingsboard, to have both of best worlds, and so far we are very happy with the results.
								We look forward to see Thingsboard being established as a weapon of choice for various IoT use cases
								and from our end we will try to contribute as much possible to it's success.</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>After a month of research, we found and selected Thingsboard. Thingsboard stood out as it is fully integrated and
								built from industrial strength components like Netty, Cassandra and Akka, which gave us the confidence that it can
								scale out and up. That is important as we don’t want a system upgrade and migration if the system fails to scale out
								or gives a poor performance after production.</p>
							<br/><br/>
							<p>Another thing we love Thingsboard is its user interface/dashboard and its widget library. We can build beautiful and
								professional IoT dashboard with drag and drop of the widgets. If you see the official demo, you must agree with me.</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>Thingsboard offers a secure, scalable IoT solution that, being Open Source, we can control.
								Having created our own Thingsboard instance, we have found it to be very customisable via widgets,
								the rule engine and the plugin system allowing it to be used in a variety of specialist situations.</p>
