## Deployment of the site locally

The below commands set up your environment for running GitHub pages locally. 
Any edits you make will be viewable on a lightweight webserver that runs on your local machine.

Install Ruby 2.2 or higher. If you're on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS, run these commands:

	sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
	sudo apt-add-repository ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install make ruby ruby-dev libffi-dev g++ zlib1g-dev
	sudo gem install github-pages
	sudo gem install jekyll bundler

* If you're on a Mac, follow [these instructions](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/).
* If you're on a Windows machine you can use the [Ruby Installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/). During the installation make sure to check the option for *Add Ruby executables to your PATH*.


Clone our site:

	git clone https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard.github.io.git

Make any changes you want. Then, to see your changes locally:

	cd thingsboard.github.io
	bundle install
	bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
	
In case you change the layout or website structure you might need to execute following command:

    rm -rf _site .jekyll-metadata && bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
        
or execute the below script from the project root directory:
        
    ./restart.sh


Your copy of the site will then be viewable at: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
(or wherever Jekyll tells you).
