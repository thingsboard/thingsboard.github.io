<h1 class="usecase-title">Smart Irrigation solution</h1>

Everyone knows that when it comes to agriculture, the critical indicator of success is the yield and high quality of the product. However, achieving these indicators costs farmers a lot of effort and resources. One of the main conditions for the stable production of agricultural products is the necessary soil moisture for the growth of crops. However, not all regions can boast of ideal climatic conditions. Sometimes the lack of soil moisture and improper monitoring and care of crops during growth can lead to negative consequences: loss of harvest and, as a result - profit.

An irrigation system is usually used to solve the problem of agricultural and irrigated land, which helps farmers achieve good results in growing and harvesting products.

We developed the Smart Irrigation <a href="/docs/paas/solution-templates/smart-irrigation">template</a> to represent a generic field irrigation solution.

<h2>Solution Structure</h2>

Smart Irrigation dashboard allows you to monitor the irrigation system and respond in time to changes in field conditions and has components that you may easily embed into your IoT solution.

Also, this dashboard has several states: **Main state** and **Field state**:
- **Main state**  is intended for the user to list the fields and monitor their soil moisture, location, statistics, etc.;
- **Field state** displays detailed information about the field. It allows you to manage moisture monitoring sensors, observes soil moisture levels, schedule irrigation, view statistics, etc.

<h2>Smart Irrigation Benefits</h2>
Save up to 90% of development time for your smart irrigation solution by utilizing the following platform benefits:
- reliable and scalable data collection for your smart sensors and soil moisture monitors;
- powerful rule engine to process collected data and produce alarms and valuable insights;
- advanced and flexible visualization for real-time and historical data;
- customizable end-user dashboards to analyze and share the results of soil moisture monitoring;
- integration with third-party analytics frameworks and solutions for advanced usage analytics;
- remote control and OTA updates for your smart sensors and other devices;
- customizable mobile applications with minimum coding efforts.

## Smart Irrigation solution overview 

The diagram below identifies data flow and integration points for a typical smart irrigation monitoring solution that uses the ThingsBoard platform to collect and analyze monitoring data from sensors.

<object width="100%" style="max-width: max-content; margin: 32px 0" data="/images/iot-use-cases/smart-energy-diagram.svg"></object>

You may notice plenty of connectivity options for the soil moisture sensors: direct connection to the cloud, through the IoT Gateway, or an Integration with a third-party system.
The platform supports industry-standard encryption algorithms and device credentials types. ThingsBoard stores data in the fault-tolerant and reliable Cassandra database. 
The Rule Engine enables forwarding incoming data to various analytics systems, such as Apache Spark or Hadoop, using Kafka or other Message buses.
