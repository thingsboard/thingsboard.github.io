</div>


Additional Features of Complete Fleet Management using IoT:


<span class="bold-text">Document Management</span> — manage crucial documents such as driver licenses, insurance, registration documents, and maintenance records. Trigger notifications when these documents are nearing expiration, enabling proactive actions.

<span class="bold-text">Automated Driver Assignment</span> — streamline operations by using RFID cards for driver identification, allowing automatic assignment to vehicles at the beginning of each day.

<span class="bold-text">Fleet Safety Notifications</span> — receive timely notifications about safety incidents, allowing fleet managers to respond promptly or triggering emergency response services.

## Fleet Tracking Dashboard Examples


As part of this solution, we have created a dashboard that displays data from tracking fleet management sensors. This dashboard helps to monitor and control location, speed, and fuel level in real-time. Our dashboard has multiple states — Main state and Bus state.

<span class="bold-text">Main state</span> contains an interactive map for monitoring the movement of transport, a list of existing buses with detailed information about them, and a table of Alarms.

<span class="bold-text">Bus</span> contains an interactive map of the history of the route, the current route area, detailed information about the bus, and corresponding alarms.

Collected data is processed via the rule engine to raise alarms when:
- vehicle leaves configurable route perimeter;
- the vehicle is not moving for 2 minutes while on the route;
- fuel level is low;
- violation of speed limits.

The following interactive dashboard presents an intelligent visualization of IoT data that you can easily integrate into your IoT solution. See more details <a href="/docs/paas/solution-templates/fleet-tracking/">here</a>.

## Fleet tracking dashboard

The following interactive dashboard hosted on live demo server represents vehicle routes and state indicators that may be embedded in your IoT fleet tracking project.

</div>

The live Fleet Tracking dashboard displays real-time data from several tracking sensors collected using ThingsBoard MQTT API. Collected data is processed via the rule engine to raise alarms on certain thresholds. You may export the dashboard from our live demo server and import it to your ThingsBoard instance.

ThingsBoard’s fleet management IoT solutions are meticulously crafted to offer unparalleled insights, efficiency, and adaptability.

<span class="bold-text">Fleet Tracking Solution Overview.</span> At the core of our offerings is the fleet management system using IoT, illustrated below in a comprehensive diagram.

<object width="100%" style="max-width: max-content; margin: 32px 0" data="/images/iot-use-cases/fleet-tracking.svg"></object>

You may notice plenty of connectivity options for the vehicle trackers: direct connection to the cloud, through the IoT Gateway, or integration with a third-party system. Most of vehicle-tracking projects today use a direct connection to the cloud using MQTT or CoAP in the case of NB IoT. ThingsBoard supports either plain JSON or Protobuf, which significantly optimize network traffic and increase battery life.

<span class="bold-text">Robust Security Measures.</span> Ensuring the utmost security, ThingsBoard incorporates industry-standard encryption algorithms and supports various device credential types. Data is stored in the fault-tolerant and reliable Cassandra database, assuring the integrity and resilience of your IoT fleet monitoring data.

<span class="bold-text">Rule Engine for Advanced Analytics.</span> A standout feature of our solutions is the Rule Engine, facilitating the forwarding of incoming data to various analytics systems. This includes but is not limited to Apache Spark or Hadoop, achieved through integration with Kafka or other Message buses. 

In essence, ThingsBoard's fleet management tracking solutions transcend the ordinary, offering a versatile and adaptive framework for businesses seeking to optimize their fleet tracking endeavors.
