The platform provides production-ready server infrastructure to connect your IoT devices, store, analyze and share collected IoT data;

## Environment monitoring dashboard

The following interactive dashboard represents an environment monitoring component that you may easily embed into your IoT solution. 
This particular dashboard allows users to monitor temperature and humidity sensors. 
You may quickly adapt it to Air quality or other sensors and add remote control scenarios.

</div>

The live dashboard is part of the [solution template](https://thingsboard.io/docs/paas/solution-templates/temperature-humidity-sensors/) and displays real-time data from temperature and humidity sensor collected using ThingsBoard MQTT API.
You may use the dashboard to:

* add new sensors;
* change the location of the sensors; 
* configure the alarm thresholds;
* browse historical data.

The dashboard has two states. The main state displays the list of the sensors, their location on the map as well as the list of their alarms. 
You may drill down to the sensor details state by clicking on the table row. The sensor details state allows to browse temperature and humidity history, change sensor settings and location.

## Environment monitoring solution overview

The diagram below identifies data flow and integration points for a typical environment monitoring solution that uses the ThingsBoard platform to collect and analyze data from IoT sensors.

<object width="100%" style="max-width: max-content; margin: 32px 0" data="/images/iot-use-cases/common-edge.svg"></object>

You may notice plenty of connectivity options for the IoT sensors: direct connection to the cloud, through the IoT Gateway, integration with a third-party system or ThingsBoard Edge.
Most of the environment monitoring projects today use IoT Gateway deployed at the monitoring site. 
Usually this device is either running [ThingsBoard IoT Gateway](/docs/iot-gateway/what-is-iot-gateway/) or using [Gateway API](/docs/reference/gateway-mqtt-api/).
Using the gateway, customers optimize hardware and connectivity cost. You may connect multiple sensors (even using physical wire) to a hub and use only one connectivity module.

Advanced environment monitoring IoT solutions may use LoRaWAN or SigFox devices as well.

The platform supports industry-standard encryption algorithms and device credentials types. ThingsBoard stores data in the fault-tolerant and reliable Cassandra database.
The Rule Engine enables forwarding incoming data to various analytics systems, such as Apache Spark or Hadoop, using Kafka or other Message buses.
