<h2>Solution Structure</h2>

As a part of this solution we have created a Waste Management dashboard that displays data from multiple sensors.

The **Waste Management** dashboard is designed for tenant administrators to perform basic device management tasks, and has multiple states:
- **Main state** - intended for monitoring garbage bin filling, control over the alarm, and sensors management;
- **Bin state** - designed to edit and revise a particular garbage bin.


<h2>Waste Management Benefits</h2>
Save up to 90% of development time for your waste management solution by utilizing the following platform benefits:
- reliable and scalable data collection for your waste monitors;
- powerful rule engine to process collected data and produce alarms and valuable insights;
- advanced and flexible visualization for real-time and historical data;
- customizable end-user dashboards to analyze and share the results of waste monitoring;
- integration with third-party analytics frameworks and solutions for advanced usage analytics;
- remote control and OTA updates for your smart sensors and other devices;
- customizable mobile applications with minimum coding efforts.

## Waste Management solution overview 

The diagram below identifies data flow and integration points for a typical waste management solution that uses the ThingsBoard platform to collect and analyze monitoring data from waste sensors.

<object width="100%" style="max-width: max-content; margin: 32px 0" data="/images/iot-use-cases/smart-energy-diagram.svg"></object>

You may notice plenty of connectivity options for the waste sensors: direct connection to the cloud, through the IoT Gateway, or an Integration with a third-party system.
The platform supports industry-standard encryption algorithms and device credentials types. ThingsBoard stores data in the fault-tolerant and reliable Cassandra database. 
The Rule Engine enables forwarding incoming data to various analytics systems, such as Apache Spark or Hadoop, using Kafka or other Message buses.
