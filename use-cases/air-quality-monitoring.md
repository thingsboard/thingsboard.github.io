<h1 class="usecase-title">Air Quality Monitoring solution</h1>

Air quality control is an important component of modern life, as high levels of pollutants can negatively affect people's health. 
Particularly noteworthy are megacities with a large number of cars and industrial areas in which the concentration of pollutants is higher.

We developed the AIR Quality Monitoring <a href="/docs/paas/solution-templates/air-quality-monitoring">template</a> which represents a solution for general air pollution monitoring and provides general recommendations in a user-friendly manner. 
The main metric for controlling the level of air pollution is AQI.
AQI is calculated based on the sensor readings about such pollutants: Ozone (ppm), PM2.5 (µg/m3 ), PM10 (µg/m3 ), CO (ppm), SO2 (ppb), NO2 (ppb);
The solution supports sensors that report either all or a subset of the readings.
You will also have the opportunity to manage air control stations using the Administration Dashboard.

You can use this solution as a part of a Smart City and cover the all needed requirements.

<h2>Solution Structure</h2>

As part of this solution, we have created 2 dashboards that display data from multiple sensors - **Public Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard** and **Administration Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard**.

The **Public Dashboard** is designed for end-users. It is configured to be "public", meaning the end-user does NOT need to log in to access the dashboard. The dashboard has multiple states:
- **City state** represents the air pollution monitoring of a specific city (in our case Los Angeles) and calculates  value based on the AQI received from city sensors.
- **Sensor state** represents the selected sensor deployed in a particular city district.

<h2>Air Quality Monitoring Benefits</h2>
Save up to 90% of development time for your air monitoring solution by utilizing the following platform benefits:
- reliable and scalable data collection for your smart monitors;
- powerful rule engine to process collected data and produce alarms and valuable insights;
- advanced and flexible visualization for real-time and historical data;
- customizable end-user dashboards to analyze and share the results of air quality monitoring;
- integration with third-party analytics frameworks and solutions for advanced usage analytics;
- remote control and OTA updates for your smart sensors and other devices;
- customizable mobile applications with minimum coding efforts.

The **Administration Dashboard** dashboard is designed for tenant administrators to perform basic device management tasks, and has multiple states:
-  **Main state** which is intended for monitoring sensors health: battery level, connectivity, etc. The Main state contains:
- **Sensor state** allows you to view detailed information about the sensor: It's latest sensor readings, location, etc.
