## Tank Level Monitoring Solution Structure

We have developed a Fuel Level Monitoring solution template that allows you to provision tanks and monitor the fuel level.
This dashboard empowers you to check fuel levels meticulously and react promptly to alterations in the tank state.  
It features components that can be effortlessly integrated into your IoT solution, enhancing the adaptability and user-friendliness of the system. 
Additionally, the dashboard is equipped with multiple states, allowing for a diverse range of interactions and data presentations to accommodate varying user needs and preferences:

**Main state** - designed to monitor the remaining fuel and control the placement of tanks, device management, and the alarm system;

**Tank state** - designed to display information about a specific tank.

## Tank Level Monitoring dashboard

The Fuel Level Monitoring interactive dashboard contains 2 states that are specialised for monitoring fuel levels in tanks, observing consumption statistics, managing devices.

## Tank level monitoring solution overview

The diagram below identifies data flow and integration points for a typical fuel level monitoring solution that uses the ThingsBoard platform to collect and analyze data from fuel tanks.

<object width="100%" style="max-width: max-content; margin: 32px 0" data="/images/iot-use-cases/smart-energy-diagram.svg"></object>

You may notice plenty of connectivity options for the fuel tanks devices: direct connection to the cloud, through the IoT Gateway or integration with a third-party system.
Most of a fuel level monitoring projects today use direct connection to the cloud using MQTT or CoAP in case of NB IoT. 
ThingsBoard supports either plain JSON or Protobuf, which significantly optimize network traffic and increase battery life.

The platform supports industry-standard encryption algorithms and device credentials types. ThingsBoard stores data in the fault-tolerant and reliable Cassandra database.
The Rule Engine enables forwarding incoming data to various analytics systems, such as Apache Spark or Hadoop, using Kafka or other Message buses.
