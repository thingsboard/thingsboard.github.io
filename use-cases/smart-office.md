## Smart office template

Smart Office [template](https://thingsboard.io/docs/paas/solution-templates/smart-office/) represents a basic work space monitoring and management solution. 
With this layout you get an interactive dashboard with the ability to control HVAC system, 
and have a high-level report of key metrics necessary for effective and proactive office management.

</div>

The live dashboard is part of the [solution template](https://thingsboard.io/docs/paas/solution-templates/smart-office/) 
and displays office floor plan and data from various IoT sensors that is collected using ThingsBoard MQTT API.

You may use the dashboard to:

* observe office sensors and their location;
* browse indoor temperature and power consumption history;
* monitor temperature alarms;
* control HVAC (requires connected device);
* observe specific details for each sensor.

The dashboard has multiple states. The main state displays the list of the devices, their location on the office map as well as the list of their alarms.
You may drill down to the device details state by clicking on the table row. The device details are specific to the device type.

## Smart office solution overview

The diagram below identifies data flow and integration points for a typical smart office solution that uses the ThingsBoard platform to collect and analyze data from IoT sensors.

<object width="100%" style="max-width: max-content; margin: 32px 0" data="/images/iot-use-cases/common-edge.svg"></object>

You may notice plenty of connectivity options for the IoT sensors: direct connection to the cloud, through the IoT Gateway, integration with a third-party system or ThingsBoard Edge.
Most of the smart office projects today use IoT Gateway deployed at the office site. 
Usually this device is either running [ThingsBoard IoT Gateway](/docs/iot-gateway/what-is-iot-gateway/) or using [Gateway API](/docs/reference/gateway-mqtt-api/).
Using the gateway, customers optimize hardware and connectivity cost. You may connect multiple sensors via BLE or other technology to a gateway and use only one WiFi or wired connectivity module.

Advanced smart-office IoT solutions may use LoRaWAN or SigFox devices as well.

The platform supports industry-standard encryption algorithms and device credentials types. ThingsBoard stores data in the fault-tolerant and reliable Cassandra database.
The Rule Engine enables forwarding incoming data to various analytics systems, such as Apache Spark or Hadoop, using Kafka or other Message buses.
