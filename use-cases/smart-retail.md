<h1 class="usecase-title">Smart retail solutions</h1>

Smart retail [solution template](/docs/paas/solution-templates/smart-retail) represent generic smart retail solution. 
As a solution provider, you may provision multiple Customers 
and assign pool of IoT devices to each customer.

Each Customer may provision their supermarket assets including custom floor plans.
Either you our your customer may physically install the devices and logically place them on the floor plan.

Customer users may configure specific thresholds per each device. 
All the logic to raise the alarms is already pre-configured in the corresponding device profiles.  

With this template you get interactive dashboards that allow you and your customers to 
browse current and historical state of their supermarkets.

</div>

The live dashboard is part of the [solution template](/docs/paas/solution-templates/smart-retail) and 
is designed for supermarket managers to monitor state of the supermarket and react on alarms. It has multiple states:

* **Main** state contains a map of the supermarkets, and a list of alarms.
  Alarms are propagated from devices to the corresponding supermarket.
  The platform calculates state of each supermarket based on the highest severity of the propagated alarms.
  As a user, you are able to filter supermarkets on the map based on the state of the supermarket. 
* **Floor plan** state contains an indoor map with the floor plan of supermarket and device markers.
  Besides the map, state also contains two filters: based on device type and device state.
  Filter settings are persisted on the user level.
    * State filter allows you to filter devices based on the highest severity of the alarms. 
      For example, you may choose to display devices that have at least one critical alarm.
    * Device type filter allows you to show or hide specific devices based on the type of device.
      For example, you may display only Freezers and Chillers and hide all other devices.
    * Click on specific device marker to display device details state in the right panel of the dashboard.
      Content of the device details is specific to the device type. 
      For example, freezer device have a line chart with the temperature readings while smart bin has a bar chart with the fullness level.
      Nevertheless, the common elements of the device details is the header and alarms list.
      Header contains information about current state of the device and it's battery level (if device is battery powered). 
      Header also allows you to navigate to the settings of the particular device. Those settings allow you to configure the alarm thresholds.
      
Some dashboard features (for example, ability to delete devices) were disabled on the live demo dashboard because it is publicly available.

Once you install the solution template, you will also receive access to "**Smart Supermarket Administration**"
that allows you to provision customers, their users, supermarkets and devices. It has multiple states:

* **Main** state allows you to list the retail companies (customers). 
  We assume that the customer is a retail company that own one or multiple supermarkets.
  We have provisioned two "fake" retail companies with number of supermarkets for demonstration purposes.
 * **Device management** state allows you to manage devices in scope of the retail company (customer).
  You may provision new devices or delete existing devices. The state displays a table with all devices assigned to this retail company.
  This means that Tenant or Supermarket Administrator will be able to use those devices to position them in the Supermarket.
  You may treat this list as a pool of devices that are available for installation in the Supermarkets of the Customer. 
* **Supermarket management** state allows you to manage supermarkets in scope of the retail company (customer).
    The dashboard state displays supermarkets on the map and a list of supermarkets in the table.  
    Supermarkets are assets that may contain multiple devices and few attributes: floor plan and address.
* **Supermarket devices** state displays an indoor map with the floor plan of supermarket and device markers.
    You may drag-and-drop the device markers to define precise location of the device in the supermarket.

## Smart retail solution overview

The diagram below identifies data flow and integration points for a typical supermarket monitoring solution that uses the ThingsBoard platform to collect and analyze data from multiple sources.

<object width="100%" style="max-width: max-content; margin: 32px 0" data="/images/iot-use-cases/common-edge.svg"></object>

You may notice plenty of connectivity options for the IoT sensors: direct connection to the cloud, through the IoT Gateway, integration with a third-party system or ThingsBoard Edge. 

The platform supports industry-standard encryption algorithms and device credentials types. ThingsBoard stores data in the fault-tolerant and reliable Cassandra database.
The Rule Engine enables forwarding incoming data to various analytics systems, such as Apache Spark or Hadoop, using Kafka or other Message buses.
