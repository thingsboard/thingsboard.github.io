                    <p>Traditional agriculture is based on experience and practices passed down from generation to generation. This approach uses natural methods to grow crops, relying heavily on manual labour and traditional technologies.</p>
                    <p>In conventional agriculture, the entire field is treated as a single unit and inputs are applied evenly across the land. Farmers use standardized amounts of water, pesticides and fertilizers, which often leads to wastage of resources. Despite its simplicity, traditional agriculture remains effective because farmers have a deep understanding of their land and crops, which allows them to successfully manage pests and diseases.</p>
