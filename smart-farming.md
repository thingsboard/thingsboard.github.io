                    <p>Traditional agriculture is based on experience and practices passed down from generation to generation. This approach uses natural methods to grow crops, relying heavily on manual labour and traditional technologies.</p>
                    <p>In conventional agriculture, the entire field is treated as a single unit and inputs are applied evenly across the land. Farmers use standardized amounts of water, pesticides and fertilizers, which often leads to wastage of resources. Despite its simplicity, traditional agriculture remains effective because farmers have a deep understanding of their land and crops, which allows them to successfully manage pests and diseases.</p>

                <h2>Key differences between traditional and smart farming</h2>
                <p>The differences between traditional and smart farming are increasingly evident as agriculture evolves. Traditional farming relies heavily on manual labor, with tasks such as planting, monitoring, irrigation, and harvesting performed by hand, requiring a significant workforce and long hours of work. In contrast, smart farming reduces the need for manual labor by incorporating automated equipment and smart farming system. For example, automatic irrigation systems and drones can monitor and water crops, improving efficiency and reducing labor requirements.</p>
                <p>While traditional farming has its advantages proven over the years, smart farming offers significant benefits in efficiency, productivity, and sustainability. By integrating smart agricultural technology, farmers can optimize resource use, improve crop quality, and ensure environmental sustainability. Transitioning to smart farming can help meet the growing global food demand while addressing modern agricultural challenges, as climate change.</p>
