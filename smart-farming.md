The platform provides production-ready server infrastructure to connect your IoT devices, store and analyze collected IoT data and optimize returns on inputs and resources.

## Smart farming dashboard

The following interactive dashboard represents a smart-farming component that you may easily embed into your IoT solution. 
This particular dashboard allows users to monitor and control the aeration inside silos. 
You may quickly adapt it to other farm assets tracking or remote control scenarios.

</div>

The live dashboard displays real-time data from temperature, moisture, and ultrasonic sensor collected using ThingsBoard MQTT API.
Collected data is processed via the rule engine to raise alarms on certain thresholds.
The main dashboard displays the silo asset's location, corresponding alarms, and real-time data feeds.
Click on the alarm or silo row to open the asset details and access the aeration controls.
You may export the dashboard from our live demo server and import it to your ThingsBoard instance.

## Smart farming solution overview

The diagram below identifies data flow and integration points for a typical smart-farming solution that uses the ThingsBoard platform to collect and analyze data from IoT sensors.

<object width="100%" style="max-width: max-content; margin: 32px 0" data="/images/iot-use-cases/smart-farming.svg"></object>

You may notice plenty of connectivity options for the IoT sensors: direct connection to the cloud, through the IoT Gateway, integration with a third-party system or ThingsBoard Edge.
Most of the smart-farming projects today use IoT Gateway deployed at the farm. 
Usually this device is either running [ThingsBoard IoT Gateway](/docs/iot-gateway/what-is-iot-gateway/) or using [Gateway API](/docs/reference/gateway-mqtt-api/).
Using the gateway, customers optimize hardware cost and connect Modbus, BACnet and other sensors to the cloud.  

Advanced smart-farming IoT solutions may leverage the [ThingsBoard Edge](/products/thingsboard-edge/). 
The Edge computing solution is especially useful in case of poor or frequent network outages. See edge [use-cases](/docs/edge/use-cases/overview/) to learn more.

The platform supports industry-standard encryption algorithms and device credentials types. ThingsBoard stores data in the fault-tolerant and reliable Cassandra database.
The Rule Engine enables forwarding incoming data to various analytics systems, such as Apache Spark or Hadoop, using Kafka or other Message buses.
