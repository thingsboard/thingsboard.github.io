  description: Developed and manufactured in Sweden, flexible sensor-to-platform
    solution designed for scalable, low-maintenance IoT deployments. It is well-suited
    for smart buildings, facility management, utilities, and industrial environments
    requiring robust connectivity and modular sensor integration.<br> Supports
    multiple power options—battery, solar, or mains—making it adaptable to both remote
    and on-site installations. It connects over LTE-M for reliable, low-power communication
    in constrained network conditions.<br> As a BLE gateway, Integrates seamlessly
    with sensors from industry leaders such as Aguardio, ELA Innovation, and Smart
    Sensor Devices, enabling applications like leak detection, environmental monitoring,
    occupancy sensing, and air quality measurement. The device is sold pre-configured
    for the ThingsBoard platform, providing out-of-the-box compatibility and simplified
    device management at scale.
