It’s allowed us to bring our platform to market a full 18 months sooner, than if we had embarked on developing our own backend and visualisation capabilities. With such a flexible UI, even with just a basic understanding of HTML and Javascript one can quickly and easily begin customising and designing they’re own widgets. This has provided great value to our growers since we can build them customised dashboards with very little time and effort on our part. The ability to ingest data directly from our LoRaWAN MQTT broker, via the platform’s IoT Gateway feature, has eliminated the need for us to maintain a seperate middleware layer, improving our operational efficiencies.'

        1: "A well-established medium-sized company specializes in the machining of profiles used in roof opening systems and sunroofs for the automotive sector. The machining process is semi-automated, but lacked the capability to transmit production data. Our client had a need for greater transparency in their manufacturing process, especially regarding downtime and productivity tracking."
        2: 'To address this requirement, we implemented a solution that involves integrating a trigger within the machine’s program. This trigger, connected via cable, captures the power status of the milling motor and transmits this data to an IoT module. From there, we wirelessly transmit the data over LoRaWAN technology. The collected data is then processed and aggregated in our Thingsboard platform, allowing us to present it in an understandable dashboard format for production management and control purposes.'
        3: "The aggregated data is presented in a digital twin format on a dashboard, which accurately reflects the layout of the manufacturing facility, including the various machines on the floor. Each machine displays the status of its milling motors, and some machines operate with two milling heads. Performance metrics, such as efficiency and the number of production cycles (representing the produced units), are indicated with color-coded values. Green values indicate good performance, orange suggests suboptimal performance, and red signals poor performance. This visual representation enables the plant manager to quickly identify machines that may require optimization or attention."
