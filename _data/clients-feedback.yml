It’s allowed us to bring our platform to market a full 18 months sooner, than if we had embarked on developing our own backend and visualisation capabilities. With such a flexible UI, even with just a basic understanding of HTML and Javascript one can quickly and easily begin customising and designing they’re own widgets. This has provided great value to our growers since we can build them customised dashboards with very little time and effort on our part. The ability to ingest data directly from our LoRaWAN MQTT broker, via the platform’s IoT Gateway feature, has eliminated the need for us to maintain a seperate middleware layer, improving our operational efficiencies.'

This software is available with an open-source license and its website has lessons on how to use each feature, this made easy for the team to install, run and learn how to use this platform. With implementation of TB CE, we were able to develop and gather knowledge on several key-topics of the I4.0 and IoT paradigm: Security (Network, Devices and Users management), Connectivity (M2M communication and protocols), Machine Control (Programing with traditional [Python and Java] and modern [Rule Engine and RPC requests] frameworks).'

Then, we had more and more customers that asked us to be able to see their data. So, we migrated to the Professional Edition. We installed it on dedicated cloud instance. Help and support from Thingsboard team was awesome. They installed the product on our VM and they customized the installation to fit our need. Same availability when new version was available. They updated our instance with new version. To go further, we then asked Thingsboard to customize some dashboards for a dedicated customer. Once again, all was straightforward and Thingsboard team was professional. We are now also creating custom application using powerfull API integrated in the product.We highly recommend Thingsboard for their products and support.'
