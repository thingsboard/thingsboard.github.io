# ThingsBoard Community Edition vs Professional Edition: What’s the Difference

## Unlocking IoT Potential with ThingsBoard

ThingsBoard was originally created to help organizations worldwide unlock the full potential of IoT. Established with a vision to simplify and speed up IoT adoption, our mission is to make this technology accessible, scalable, and flexible for organizations of all sizes. We empower businesses to optimize operations, reduce costs, and discover new opportunities using cutting-edge tools.

To achieve this, we offer two powerful editions of our platform: Community Edition (CE) and Professional Edition (PE). Whether you start with the CE or the advanced features of PE, ThingsBoard provides a clear path to build, launch, and scale your IoT solution.


## ThingsBoard Community Edition (CE): The Open-Source Powerhouse

ThingsBoard CE is the most feature-rich, open-source IoT platform in the world, and we are committed to keeping it that way. It is a fully-functional, scalable, and fault-tolerant solution that can be deployed in a cluster and used in commercial projects. CE provides a robust foundation for building anything from a small proof-of-concept to a large-scale IoT solution.


:gear: **CE Features:**

- *Standard Protocol Support*: Connect devices via MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, SNMP, and LWM2M.
- *IoT Gateway*: Integrate industrial systems with built-in connectors (Modbus, OPC-UA, BACnet, etc).
- *Device & Asset Management*: Model your physical environment with digital twins.
- *Data Processing & Alarms*: Process data, create alarms, and trigger actions with the rule engine and calculated fields.
- *Data Visualization*: Use real-time, interactive dashboards to visualize telemetry data.
- *High Scalability*: A fault-tolerant clustering architecture supports millions of devices.

## ThingsBoard Professional Edition (PE): Enterprise-Grade Features & Support

ThingsBoard PE is built for enterprises and businesses that want to reduce time-to-market, cut development costs, and access more features out-of-the-box. Including all the powerful features of the Community Edition, we believe PE is the most feature-rich commercial IoT platform available. Our development model reflects our commitment to the open-source community, with 80% of our code changes contributed directly to CE, while PE receives additional enterprise-focused features and dedicated support.


:rocket: **PE Features:**

- *Everything from CE*.
- *Advanced Access Control (RBAC)*: Define custom user roles with granular permissions for devices, assets, and dashboards.
- *White-Labeling*:  Customize the platform with your own branding.
- *Platform Integrations*: Connect seamlessly with cloud services like AWS IoT and Azure IoT Hub, plus Kafka and LoRaWAN network servers.
- *Device Library*: Simplify LoRaWAN and other device onboarding with over 400 pre-built data converters.
- *Automated Reporting*: Generate and distribute scheduled reports to customers automatically.
- *Solution Templates*: Accelerate development with pre-built, ready-to-use IoT solution templates.
- *Support & SLA*: Get dedicated support and a guaranteed uptime SLA, key for our managed cloud offerings.

## Migration From CE to PE

One of the most powerful advantages of the ThingsBoard ecosystem is the **seamless migration path from CE to PE**.
You can start your project on CE to prove its value, and when your business is ready to scale, you can upgrade to PE without changing your core platform.

This reduces both technological and business risks, accelerates time-to-market, and enables building IoT solutions with a focus on **growth**.

## How to start using ThingsBoard CE and PE

Choosing the right edition is only half the job. It’s equally important to select the **right model** to match your goals, resources, and infrastructure strategy.

### :white_check_mark: Getting started with Community Edition

1. **Self-managed (On-premise)**
   Full control in your own or isolated data centers, or offline/on-premise setups.
