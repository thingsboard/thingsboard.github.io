| 128        | Unspecified error             | CONNACK, PUBACK, PUBREC, SUBACK, UNSUBACK, DISCONNECT | An unspecified error occurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 129        | Malformed Packet              | CONNACK, DISCONNECT                                   | Indicates that the received packet cannot be correctly parsed according to the protocol specifications.                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 131        | Implementation specific error | CONNACK, PUBACK, PUBREC, SUBACK, UNSUBACK, DISCONNECT | The packet is valid, but not accepted by the current receiver's implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 135        | Not authorized                | CONNACK, PUBACK, PUBREC, SUBACK, UNSUBACK, DISCONNECT | Indicates that the operation is not authorized. For example, the client does not have permission to publish messages to the corresponding topic.                                                                                                                          |

For example, the level of Topic Filters exceeds the maximum number allowed by the server.                                                                                                   |
