description: Supported IoT protocols for IoT device connectivity

---

Thingsboard supports following protocols for device connectivity:

 - **[MQTT](/docs/reference/mqtt-api)**
 - **[CoAP](/docs/reference/coap-api)**
 - **[HTTP](/docs/reference/http-api)** 
 
See protocol specific documentation for more details. More protocols are coming soon.

**Note** You can also connect **existing** devices to the platform using **[Thingsboard Gateway](/docs/iot-gateway/what-is-iot-gateway/)** 
or design your own gateway using **[Gateway MQTT API](/docs/reference/gateway-mqtt-api/)**.
