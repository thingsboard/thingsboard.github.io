title: Message Type Filter

---

## Overview

This component allows filtering incoming messages by type. 
This filter is very efficient. 
We recommend using this filter in almost every rule to quickly ignore irrelevant messages. 

## Configuration

You are able to select multiple types: "Get Attributes", "Post Attributes", "Post Telemetry" and "RPC Request". 

## Example

As a system administrator, you are able to review filter example inside **Rules->System Telemetry Rule->Filters->Message Telemetry Filter**.
