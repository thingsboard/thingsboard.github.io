This guide overviews all sub-dashboards of Gateway Dashboard for remote configuration.

For purpose of this guide, we will use following things:
1. Locally installed instance of ThingsBoard platform (How to install you can [read here](/docs/user-guide/install/installation-options/)).
2. ThingsBoard IoT Gateway (How to install you can [read here](/docs/iot-gateway/installation/)).

Resources (OPTIONAL):
1. [Gateway Dashboard](/docs/iot-gateway/resources/dashboard.json){:target="_blank" download="dashboard.json"}
2. [Gateway Widget Bundle](/docs/iot-gateway/resources/bundle.json){:target="_blank" download="bundle.json"}

## Dashboard overview

### Gateway List

![](/images/gateway/dashboard/gateway-dashboard-list.png)

This dashboard displays all your gateways and all the necessary details about them, namely:
- Date and time of creation;
- Name of the gateway;
- Status (Active/Inactive);
- Number of active connectors;
- Gateway version.

And also navigation elements:
- **Docker command** - when clicked, a modal window opens with a command to launch the gateway;
- **Gateway configuration** - when clicked, a modal window with general gateway settings opens;
- **Connectors** - when clicked, a page for managing and configuring connectors opens.

Also, on this page, you can create a new gateway, as well as sort them according to the parameters described above.

### Gateway Dashboard

If you select a gateway and click on it, you will be transferred to the dashboard of the selected gateway.
