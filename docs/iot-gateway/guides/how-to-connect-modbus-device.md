## Overview

In this guide, we will describe how to connect an Modbus device to ThingsBoard CE using ThingsBoard IoT Gateway.
Whether you are just starting with Modbus protocol or looking to streamline your existing setup, this guide will
provide you with the essential knowledge to get up and running quickly.

**What is ThingsBoard IoT Gateway?**

The ThingsBoard IoT Gateway is an open-source solution that serves as a bridge between IoT devices connected to
legacy or third-party systems and the ThingsBoard platform. It enables seamless integration of devices that cannot
communicate with ThingsBoard directly, ensuring data can be collected, processed, and visualized in real time. With
the IoT Gateway, you can connect multiple devices, aggregate telemetry, and manage configurations centrally. It
supports flexible deployment scenarios, making it especially suitable for industrial automation, monitoring, and smart
energy systems where Modbus is widely used.

**What is Modbus?**

Modbus supports different communication modes, including serial (Modbus RTU and ASCII) and network-based (Modbus
TCP/IP), making it adaptable to a wide range of industrial environments. Its simplicity and open standard have
contributed to its widespread adoption, allowing devices from different manufacturers to communicate seamlessly. Despite
being decades old, Modbus remains relevant today due to its reliability, ease of implementation, and compatibility with
modern industrial systems. Additionally, it is often used as a backbone protocol for data acquisition, process
monitoring, and control in applications ranging from manufacturing plants to building automation.

**What will You Learn?**

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to connect a Modbus device to ThingsBoard CE using the ThingsBoard
IoT Gateway. You will learn how to configure the gateway, set up the Modbus connector and map data points and send them
to ThingsBoard. By the end of this guide, you will have a solid understanding of how to leverage the power of
ThingsBoard IoT Gateway to integrate Modbus devices into your IoT ecosystem. By the end of this guide, you will have a
working setup that allows you to seamlessly monitor and analyze your Modbus device data in ThingsBoard CE.

## Prerequisites

- Before initiating the Gateway setup, ensure that the ThingsBoard server is up and running. You can install ThingsBoard
  CE manually by following the steps outlined in
  the [Installation Guide](/docs/user-guide/install/installation-options/).
- Before moving forward, ensure Docker is installed and properly configured on your machine. If you haven't installed
  Docker yet, you can download it from the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and follow
  their installation guide for your specific operating system.

## Modbus Device Structure Overview

For this guide, we will use a ThingsBoard Modbus Demo Device, which simulates a Modbus device and provides a
convenient way to test and demonstrate Modbus communication with ThingsBoard. The demo device is pre-configured with a
set of registers and data points that mimic the behavior of a real Modbus device. It allows users to interact with the
device, read and write data, and observe how the data is processed and visualized in ThingsBoard.

The ThingsBoard Modbus Demo Device is designed to help users understand the Modbus protocol and how to integrate
Modbus devices into their IoT solutions using ThingsBoard. It provides a practical and hands-on way to explore
the capabilities of ThingsBoard in the context of Modbus communication.

The Modbus Demo Device has the following structure:

| Variable Name  | Register Type   | Data Type  | Address    |
|:---------------|:----------------|------------|:-----------|
| Temperature    | Holding         | 16int      | 0          |
| Humidity       | Holding         | 16int      | 1          |
| Power          | Holding         | 16int      | 2          |
| Pressure       | Holding         | 16int      | 3          |
| Relay          | Coil            | bits       | 1          |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |

To up and run the Modbus Demo Device, you can use Docker and the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 5021:5021 thingsboard/tb-gw-modbus-server:latest
```

{:.copy-code}

The server will be available at `0.0.0.0:5021`.

{% capture difference %}
We will use `host.docker.internal` instead of `0.0.0.0` in our Gateway connector configuration to allow the Docker 
container to access another Docker container.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=difference %}

By working with the Demo Device and its registers, you'll see how to extract real-time telemetry data and then forward
it to ThingsBoard for monitoring and analysis.

## Step 1. Create a new gateway device on ThingsBoard

First, add a gateway device to your ThingsBoard instance by following these steps:

{% assign createNewGatewayDevice = '
    ===
        image: /images/gateway/dashboard/gateway-getting-started-1-ce.png,
        title: Go to "**Entities**" > "**Gateways**" tab.
    ===
        image: /images/gateway/dashboard/gateway-getting-started-2-ce.png,
        title: Click the "**+**" button, enter the gateway device name (e.g., "My Gateway"), and select the device profile. Click on "**Create**" button.
'
%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=createNewGatewayDevice %} 

To launch the gateway, use the following steps:

{% assign remoteCreateGatewayDocker = '
    ===
        image: /images/gateway/dashboard/gateway-getting-started-3-ce.png,
        title: Select and click on newly created gateway, click on **"Launch command"** button in the top right corner.
    ===
        image: /images/gateway/dashboard/gateway-getting-started-4-ce.png,
        title: Click to download `docker-compose.yml` file to your PC, copy command and execute it in your terminal.
'
%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=remoteCreateGatewayDocker %}

After running gateway docker image, you can see the following logs in your terminal:

![](/images/gateway/dashboard/launch-gateway-docker.png)

## Step 2. Add new Modbus connector

Let’s add a Modbus connector, which will read described before data from a simulated Modbus device to the 
created gateway. To create a connector, follow these steps:

{% assign addNewConnector = '
    ===
        image: /images/gateway/dashboard/gateway-getting-started-7-ce.png,
        title: Click on "**Connectors configuration**" button on the right panel;
    ===
        image: /images/gateway/dashboard/gateway-getting-started-8-ce.png,
        title: Click the "**+ Add connector**" button;
    ===
        image: /images/gateway/dashboard/gateway-getting-started-modbus-9-ce.png,
        title: Choose "**Modbus**" connector type from the dropdown, fill in "**Name**" field, choose "**Logging level**" to "**INFO**", turn off the "**Fill configuration with default values**" option and click on "**Add**" button;
    ===
        image: /images/gateway/modbus-connector/guides/connector-configuration.png,
        title: Choose “**Advanced**” configuration mode, click on “**Configuration**” tab and paste connector configuration (_you can find it under these steps_).
    ===
        image: /images/gateway/modbus-connector/guides/connector-configuration-save.png,
        title: Click on “**Save**” button to apply changes.
'
%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=addNewConnector %}

        "rpc": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
{:.copy-code.expandable-10}

Let’s break our connector configuration into smaller pieces and provide an explanation:

- `master.slaves` - a list of Modbus “devices” the gateway will talk to. We have just one.
- `host: "host.docker.internal"` – the IP/hostname of the Modbus server. This value makes a Dockerized gateway reach your host machine.
- `pollPeriod: 1000` – poll the device every 1000 ms (1 second).
- `unitId: 1` – the Modbus unit/slave ID on the target (for TCP, this is still used by many gateways).
- `deviceName: "Modbus PLC"` – the ThingsBoard device name that will receive the data.
- `attributes` - a list of Modbus registers that will be read as device attributes in ThingsBoard.
- `timeseries` - a list of Modbus registers that will be read as device telemetry in ThingsBoard.
- `tag` - the key name that appears in ThingsBoard.
- `type` - how to decode the raw data (e.g., 16int is a signed 16-bit integer; bits is a coil/bitfield).
- `functionCode` - the Modbus function code to use when reading the data (e.g., 3 is for holding registers, 1 is for coils).
- `address` - the Modbus address to read from (e.g., 0 for temperature, 1 for humidity, etc.).
- `divider` - a modifier that divides the read value by 10 to get the actual value.

## Step 3. Check device data

To review the data uploaded from your gateway, use the following step:

{% assign checkDeviceData = '
    ===
        image: /images/gateway/modbus-connector/guides/review-device-data.png,
        title: Navigate to the **Entities** > **Devices** page and click on the created device "**Modbus PLC**" as we named it in the “**deviceName**” field . This will open the device details page. From there, switch to the **"Latest telemetry"** tab to view the real-time data that were configured in the connector.
'
%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=checkDeviceData %}
