This guide will help you use the OPC-UA Connector example's built-in GET/SET RPC methods.


Every telemetry and attribute parameter has **GET** and **SET** RPC methods out of the box, so you don't need to configure
it manually.
For example, if you have some telemetry parameter:
```json
"timeseries": [
  {
    "key": "temperature",
    "path": "${ns=3;i=1001}"
  }
]
```
To get temperature telemetry current value:
```bash
get ns=3;i=1001
```
Response:
```json
{"get": 25.34, "code": 200}
```

To set temperature telemetry value:
```bash
set ns=3;i=1001 23
```

To set new value (T3000) for **"model"** attribute, run the query:
```bash
set ns=3;i=1008; T3000
```

Response:
```json
{"success":"true","code": 200}
```
