This guide will help you to enable remote shell feature and control operation system with ThingsBoard IoT Gateway from your ThingsBoard platform instance.  

For purpose of this guide, we will use following things:
1. Instance of ThingsBoard platform (How to install you can [read here](/docs/user-guide/install/installation-options/)). For this guide we will use [thingsboard.cloud](https://thingsboard.cloud)
2. Installed and configured ThingsBoard IoT Gateway (How to install you can [read here](/docs/iot-gateway/installation/)).

## Step 1. Remote shell activation

 - To activate remote shell in ThingsBoard IoT Gateway you should add or change parameter **remoteShell** to **true** in the section **thingsboard** in the general configuration file (**tb_gateway.yaml**);

  <br>
{% capture info %}
<div>
  <p>
    <b style="color:red">WARNING:</b>
    <span style="color:black">this feature can cause security problems for your device, we strongly recommend using it with ssl encryption only and not enabling it if you donâ€™t need it.</span>
  </p>
</div>
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=info %}
 

 - Restart the gateway with the new configuration.

Example of the **thingsboard** section in the general configuration file:
```json
{
  "thingsboard": {
    "host": "thingsboard.cloud",
    "port": 1883,
    "security": {
      "type": "accessToken",
      "accessToken": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    }
  },
}
```

## Step 2. Create a dashboard to use the remote shell

To use the remote shell we have to use **RPC remote shell** widget from **Control widget** bundle.<br>
To do this we use following steps:
  
  - Open **Dashboards** tab;
  <br><br>
  ![](/images/gateway/remote-shell-1.png)
 
  - Add a new dashboard;
  <br><br>
  ![](/images/gateway/remote-shell-2.png)
  
  - Open created dashboard, enter edit mode by clicking **pencil** button in the bottom right corner and click "**Add new widget**" button;
  <br><br>
  ![](/images/gateway/remote-shell-3.png)
  
  - Select widget bundle - "**Control widgets**";
  <br><br>
  ![](/images/gateway/remote-shell-4.png)
  
  - Scroll down and select **RPC remote shell** widget;
  <br><br>
  ![](/images/gateway/remote-shell-5.png)
  
  - We haven't specify the entity type for the widget so we will **create a new one**;
  <br><br>
  ![](/images/gateway/remote-shell-6.png)
  
  - Fill in required fields and same the entity. **Gateway** - is our gateway device;
  <br><br>

  - To prevent TimeoutException, increase the default RPC command timeout to 5000 milliseconds in the **advanced** settings tab and press **Add**. Then apply all changes;
  <br><br>
  ![](/images/gateway/remote-shell-8.png)
  
  - The connected widget looks like (Connection setups automatically);
  <br><br>
  ![](/images/gateway/remote-shell-9.png)
  
  - Now you can use the shell to control device with the gateway. For example we run **ls** command to get the list of files and directories in the current directory.
