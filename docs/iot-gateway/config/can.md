|---

The list of supported CAN interfaces one can [find](https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html#interface-names) in the documentation of the Python CAN library.  

### Section "backend"
This section is optional and it provides configuration for specific CAN interface. Each option has default value. To get available list of options [see](https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html#interface-names) the documentation for specific interface type.  

For example, the SocketCAN interface [supports](https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interfaces/socketcan.html#bus) the following configuration options:  
* *receive_own_messages*
* *fd*
* *can_filters*

```json
"backend": {
  "receive_own_messages": true,
  "fd": true
}
```
This means that transmitted messages should also be received and CAN-FD frames should be supported. By default these options are disabled.  

### Section "devices"
This section provides array of configurations for devices, which connected through the CAN bus.  

| **Parameter**                 | **Default value**   | **Description**                                                                                                |

|---

If *enableUnknownRpc* is set to *true*, *overrideRpcConfig* is forcibly set to *true* as well.  

**Note**, despite [attributes](/docs/iot-gateway/config/can/#subsection-attributes-or-timeseries), [timeseries](/docs/iot-gateway/config/can/#subsection-attributes-or-timeseries), [attributeUpdates](/docs/iot-gateway/config/can/#subsection-attributeupdates) and [serverSideRpc](/docs/iot-gateway/config/can/#subsection-serversiderpc) are optional subsections, at least one of them must be set to get in use the device configuration.

#### Subsection "converters"
CAN connector is provided with built-in uplink/downlink data converters. One can specify custom converter for both uplink and downlink data or for one of them.

| **Parameter**                     | **Default value**   | **Description**                     |
|:-|:-|-
| uplink                            |                     | Python class of uplink converter.   |
| downlink                          |                     | Python class of downlink converter. |

*As input data* **the uplink converter** gets CAN payload (array of bytes) and list of configurations from ["attributes" and "timeseries" subsection](/docs/iot-gateway/config/can/#subsection-attributes-or-timeseries) to know which bytes to get and how they need to be interpreted.  

*As output data* **the uplink converter** returns dictionary with attribute and telemetry lists. Each element of this list is key/value pair, where key is attribute name or time series key and the value is what it is.  

```json
{
  "attributes": [{"isDriverDoorOpened": "true"}],
  "telemetry": [{"rpm":100},{"milliage": 300000}]
}
```
*As input data* **the downlink converter** gets the value (or values in case of RPC) and configuration (from ["attributeUpdates"](/docs/iot-gateway/config/can/#subsection-attributeupdates) or ["serverSideRpc"](/docs/iot-gateway/config/can/#subsection-serversiderpc) subsections) that describes how to convert the value (or values) to CAN payload.  

*As output data* **the downlink converter** returns CAN payload (array of bytes) for the further sending.  

#### Subsection "attributes" or "timeseries"
This subsection provides the list of configuration each of them describes which bytes to get from CAN payload (array of bytes) and how to convert these bytes to a Thingsboard attribute or a time series key.  

| **Parameter** | **Default value**   | **Description**                                                         |
|:-|:-|-
| **key**       |                     | Name of attribute or time series key.                                                        |
| **nodeId**    |                     | CAN node (arbitration) id.        |
| **value**     |                     | Value conversion configuration.       |
| expression    |                     | Python [eval()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) expression to modify _value_ in some way.                                                     |
| command       |                     | Command conversion configuration.                                                    |
| polling       |                     | Polling configuration.                                                     |
| isExtendedId  | **false**           | If True means extended CAN node (arbitration) id.                                                     |
| isFd          | **false**           | If True means using CAN FD mode.                                                     |
| bitrateSwitch | **false**           | **Only for CAN FD mode** If True means a higher bitrate is used for the data transmission.                                    |
|---

##### "commmand"
The option *command* is an additional but non-neccessary level of abstraction what lets one to interpret the one part of CAN message differently
based on the another part of this CAN message.

For example, the controller of an irrigation system can inform about different parameters of the system. Communication is done via CAN bus.  
The first byte of a CAN payload is *command*. If the value of a command is 2, it means that following bytes is temperature.  
If value of command is 4, data is a humidity level.

The option _command_ supports the following formats:   
 - As JSON string:
```json
command: "<start>:<length>:[byteorder]:[value]"
```
 - As JSON object: 
```json
"command": {
  "start": <start_value>,
  "length": <length_value>,
  "byteorder": <byteorder_value>,
  "value": <value>
}
```

where:
* *start* - the position of the first byte - 0 to 7 for CAN protocol, 0 to 63 for CAN FD protocol
* *length* - the number of bytes to get the value of a command
* *byteorder* - the order of bytes - *big* or *little* (default *big*)
* *value* - the integer value of a command in the decimal format

Example:


1. Read 2 bytes starting from 0th position as the *little* byte ordered and trigger processing of the following bytes only if the command value is 12345.
```json
"command": "0:2:little:12345"
```

##### "value"
The option *value* describes how many bytes to get from CAN payload and what primitive type to be converted to. 
<br>
<br>
The option _value_ supports the following formats:
 - As JSON string:
```json
"value": "<start>:<length>:[byteorder]:<type>:[encoding|signed]"
```
 - As JSON object: 
```json
"value": {
  "start": <start_value>,
  "length": <length_value>,
  "byteorder": <byteorder_value>,
  "type": <type_value>,
  "encoding": <encoding_value>,
  "signed": <signed_value>
}
```

where
* *start* - the position of the first byte - 0-7 for CAN protocol, 0-63 for CAN FD protocol
* *length* - the number of bytes to get the value
* *byteorder* - the order of bytes - *big* or *little* (default *big*)
* *type* - the Python primitive types **bool**, **boolean**, **int**, **long**, **float**, **double** or **string**.
By types **bool**, **int** and **float** it is meant Thingsboard **boolean**, **long** and **double** types respectively.
**Note**, **float** type value requires 4 bytes and **double** type value requires 8 bytes.
* *encoding* - **Only for string type** [Encoding](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings) of string (default *ascii*).
* *signed* - **Only for int/long types** indicates whether integer is signed value or not - *signed* or *unsigned* (default *unsigned*)

Examples:

 - Read 1 byte starting from 2d position as the *big* byte ordered and cast to the value of the *unsigned int* type.
```json 
"value": "2:1:int" 
``` 
 - Read 8 bytes starting from 0th position as the big byte ordered and cast to the value of the *double* type. 
```json
"value": "0:7:double"
```
 - Read 4 bytes starting from 0th position as the *little* byte ordered and cast to the value of the *float* type. 
```json
"value": "0:4:little:float"
```
 - Read 2 bytes starting from 4th position as the *little* byte ordered and cast to the value the *signed int* type. The value is used in Python [eval()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) expression to
get the final value. 
```json
"value": "4:2:little:int:signed",
"expression": "value / 4"
```

##### "expression"
The option _expression_ is evaluated via Python [eval()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) API. There are available the following variables in the [eval()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) context:

1. *value* - the result of applying the [value configuration](/docs/iot-gateway/config/can/#value) to the CAN payload
2. *can_data* - the CAN payload (array of bytes)

**Note**, by default Python [eval()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) API is working in some kind of a restricted mode by denying the explicit access to [\_\_builtins\_\_ API](https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html), to
disable the restricted mode [set](/docs/iot-gateway/config/can/#section-devices) the option *strictEval* to _False_.

##### "polling"
If a polling configuration is not specified the CAN connector receive only that data what CAN node decides to send on its own.

On demand sending activates after CAN node receives specific data which is specified in the polling configuration. Depending on the type of polling the CAN connector can send that data once or periodically.   

| **Parameter** | **Default value**     | **Description**                                                         |
|:-|:-|-
| type          | **always**            | Type *always* means sending CAN message periodically, *once* means single time sending. |
| period        | **1.0**               | Period of polling in seconds. Floating point means more precise time than seconds.      |
| **dataInHex** |                       | CAN message payload in the hexadecimal format.                                          |

The steps of processing an attribute update are the following:

1. If *dataExpression* is set, [the value](/docs/reference/gateway-mqtt-api/#subscribe-to-attribute-updates-from-the-server) that received from Thingsboard server is modified via Python [eval()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) API. The variable *value* is available in *dataExpression*. This is a value of the attribute that was changed.
If *dataExpression* is not set, the value is left as it is.
2. The value from the step 1 is packed to the array of bytes based on its type (deduced by Python [isinstance()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance) API) and [configuration](/docs/iot-gateway/config/can/#subsection-attributeupdates) provided for this attribute. **Note**, *float* type value requires 4 bytes.
3. If *dataBefore* or/and *dataAfter* are set, they are converted to the arrays of bytes and are added to the *value* bytes (from the step 2) before and after respectively.
4. Send the final byte array through a CAN bus.

#### Subsection "serverSideRpc"
This subsection provides the list of configurations to process RPC commands from a ThingsBoard server to a device.

The CAN connector supports RPC commands *without* and *with* parameters (see [params](/docs/reference/gateway-mqtt-api/#server-side-rpc) JSON object).  

The *without parameters* RPC type requires **only** *dataInHex* to be set (another *data\** options are not used). The value of *dataInHex* is sent as payload of a CAN message each time when the RPC command is processed.  

The *with parameters* RPC type is based on all *data\** options except *dataInHex*. The steps of processing are the same as for [attribute updates](/docs/iot-gateway/config/can/#subsection-attributeupdates) except:  
- if *dataExpression* is **not set**, [RPC params](/docs/reference/gateway-mqtt-api/#server-side-rpc) **must have** the JSON property named *value*. The value of this JSON property is packed to the array of bytes and send to CAN node as payload of a CAN message.  
```json
{
  "device": "Car", 
  "data": {
    "method": "setLightLevel", 
    "params": {
      "value": 70
    }
  }
}
```
- if *dataExpression* is **set**, no specific JSON property is required and [all RPC params](/docs/reference/gateway-mqtt-api/#server-side-rpc) are available in *dataExpression*.  
<br><br>For example, **user** want to pick up a car speed to **150 mph**, but a car control system has its own **limit** that is set to **100 mph**.  
```json
{
  "device": "Car", 
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "method": "setSpeed", 
    "params": {
      "userSpeed": 150,
      "maxAllowedSpeed": 100
    }
  }
}
```
The configuration of such RPC command is set in the way **whether user exceeds the limit** the speed of a car is **forcibly set to this limit**:  
```json
"serverSideRpc": [
{
    "method": "setSpeed",
    "nodeId": 16,
    "dataBefore": "09",
    "dataAfter": "aabb",
    "dataExpression": "userSpeed if maxAllowedSpeed > userSpeed else maxAllowedSpeed"
}
]
```
So after processing the _setSpeed_ RPC command CAN payload is following: 
`[ 0x09, 0x64, 0xAA, 0xBB ]`, where **0x64** is **100 mph** because **user exceeds the limit**.
