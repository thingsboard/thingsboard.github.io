This guide will help you to get familiar with FTP Connector configuration for ThingsBoard IoT Gateway.
Use [general configuration](/docs/iot-gateway/configuration/) to enable this Connector. 
The purpose of this Connector is to connect to external FTP server and get data from files from specific paths. 
Connector is also able to push data to FTP server files based on the updates/commands from ThingsBoard.

This connector is useful when you have some FTP server in your device or some data in external resource and you would like to push this data to the ThingsBoard.    

We will describe connector configuration file below. 

## Connector configuration: ftp.json

Connector configuration is a JSON file that contains information about how to connect to external FTP server, what paths to use when reading data and how to process the data.  
Let's review the format of the configuration file using example below.

<br>
<details>

</summary>

Example listed below will connect to FTP server in a local network deployed on server with IP 0.0.0.0. 
Connector will use basic FTP auth using username and password. 
Then, connector will subscribe to a list of paths from mapping section. See more info in a description below.

### General section

| **Parameter** | **Default value**                    | **Description**                                           |
|:-|:-|-
| host          | **localhost**                        | Domain address or ip of the server.                       |
| port          | **21**                               | Port of the server                                        |
| TLSSupport    | **true**                             | Verify or no TLS support on the server if available.      |
|---

#### Subsection "security"

Subsection "security" provides configuration for client authorization at FTP Server.

Anonymous<small>No security</small>%,%anonymous%,%templates/iot-gateway/ftp-connector-anonymous-security-config.md{% endcapture %}

{% include content-toggle.html content-toggle-id="mqttConnectorCredentialsConfig" toggle-spec=mqttconnectorsecuritytogglespec %}  

### Section "paths"

This configuration section contains array of objects with paths that the gateway will try to read after connecting to the server.  
Also this section contains settings about processing incoming messages (converter).  

|**Parameter**|**Default value**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|-
| path | **data/log.txt** | Path to file for reading data. |
|---

**Note** Make sure that your file extension is one of the supporting extensions by FTP connector (.txt, .json, .csv)

The **path** supports special symbols: '*' to allow to subscribe to multiple paths and files.
Let's look to another example of using **path** parameter:

|**Example Name**|**Path**|**Comments**|
|:-|:-|:-|-
| Example 1 | data/log.txt | Read data from one file (if it exists) |
| Example 2 | data/*/log.txt | Read all log.txt files from all folders that contained data folder |
| Example 3 | data/\*/\*_log.txt | Read all files that name contain _log.txt from all folders that contained data folder |
| Example 3 | data/\*.\* | Read all files with all supporting extensions that included in data folder |
|---

Now let's review another required parameter in path section.

|**Parameter**|**Available value**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|:-|-
| delimiter | , | Symbol that will use to split the data in file |
| readMode | FULL/PARTIAL | If parameter is equal to FULL, file will be reading from the start to the end. If parameter is equal to PARTIAL, file will be read from the line that was reading at the previous time |
| maxFileSize | 5 | The max file size in MB that will be reading (if file size is more than 5 MB, it will be passed) |
| pollPeriod | 60 | The period of time (in seconds) that files in the path will be reading |
| txtFileDataView | TABLE/SLICED | The txtFileDataView parameter is used only for .txt files |
| withSortingFiles | true/false | Is how the found files in path will append to array |
| attributes |  | This subsection contains parameters of the incoming message, that will be interpreted as attributes for the device. |
| timeseries |  | This subsection contains parameters of the incoming message, that will be interpreted as telemetry for the device. |
|---

Let's look how we can configure this section for different file extensions:


1. For .txt with TABLE data view and .csv files
    ```json
      "paths": [
        {
          "devicePatternName": "${temp}",
          "devicePatternType": "Device",
          "delimiter": ",",
          "path": "fol/*.*",
          "readMode": "FULL",
          "maxFileSize": 5,
          "pollPeriod": 60,
          "txtFileDataView": "TABLE",
          "withSortingFiles": true,
          "attributes": [
            {
              "type": "int",
              "key": "key",
              "value": "${temp}"
            }
          ],
          "timeseries": [
            {
              "type": "int",
              "key": "${hum}",
              "value": "${temp}"
            },
            {
              "type": "int",
              "key": "temp",
              "value": "${hum}"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    ```
    
    That mean that FTP converter will look for the next file structure:
    ```txt
    temp,hum
    1,2
    23,34
    ```
2. For .txt file with SLICED data view
    ```json
      "paths": [
        {
          "devicePatternName": "DeviceName",
          "devicePatternType": "[0:1]",
          "delimiter": ",",
          "path": "fol/table.txt",
          "readMode": "FULL",
          "maxFileSize": 5,
          "pollPeriod": 60,
          "txtFileDataView": "SLICED",
          "withSortingFiles": true,
          "attributes": [
            {
              "key": "temp",
              "value": "[1:]"
            },
            {
              "key": "tmp",
              "value": "[0:1]"
            }
          ],
          "timeseries": [
            {
              "type": "int",
              "key": "[0:1]",
              "value": "[0:1]"
            },
            {
              "type": "int",
              "key": "temp",
              "value": "[1:]"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]    
    ```

    That mean that FTP converter will look for the next file structure:
    ```txt
    1,2
    23,34
    ```
3. For .json file
    ```json
    "paths": [
        {
          "devicePatternName": "${temp}",
          "devicePatternType": "Device",
          "delimiter": ",",
          "path": "fol/*.json",
          "readMode": "FULL",
          "maxFileSize": 5,
          "pollPeriod": 60,
          "withSortingFiles": true,
          "attributes": [
            {
              "type": "int",
              "key": "key",
              "value": "${temp}"
            }
          ],
          "timeseries": [
            {
              "type": "int",
              "key": "key",
              "value": "${temp}"
            },
            {
              "type": "int",
              "key": "temp",
              "value": "${tmp}"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    ```


### Section "attributeUpdates"


This configuration section is optional.
ThingsBoard allows to provision device attributes and fetch some of them from the device application. You can treat this as a remote configuration for devices. Your devices are able to request shared attributes from ThingsBoard. See user guide for more details.

The “attributeRequests” configuration allows configuring the format of the corresponding attribute data that will be written to the specific files.

| **Parameter**                 | **Default value**                                     | **Description**                                                                                    |
|:-|:-|-
| path                          | **fol/${attributeKey}/${attributeValue}.txt**         | JSON-path expression that uses for finding specific files               |
| deviceNameFilter              | **.\***                                               | Regular expression device name filter, uses to determine, which function to execute.            |
| writingMode                   | **OVERRIDE/WRITE**                                    | If writingMode is equal to OVERRIDE, the found files will we overwrite. If writingMode is equal to WRITE, a new data will be appended at the end of found files                |
| valueExpression               | **,,,,${attributeKey},,,${attributeValue}**           | Expression uses for creating the message data that will send to FTP server. In this case ',' has a role as the delimiter and before him, you can insert your data.                   |
|---

This section in configuration file looks like:

```json
  "attributeUpdates": [
    {
      "path": "fol/${attributeKey}/${attributeValue}.txt",
      "deviceNameFilter": ".*",
      "writingMode": "OVERRIDE",
      "valueExpression": ",,,,${attributeKey},,,${attributeValue}"
    }
  ]
```

### Server side RPC commands

ThingsBoard allows sending RPC commands to the device that is connected to ThingsBoard directly or via Gateway.

Configuration, provided in this section uses for sending RPC requests from ThingsBoard to device.

| **Parameter**                 | **Default value**                                     | **Description**                                                                                    |
|:-|:-|-
| deviceNameFilter              | **.\***                                               | Regular expression device name filter, uses to determine, which function to execute.            |
| methodFilter                  | **read/write**                                        | Mode for opening file                |
| valueExpression               | **,,,,${attributeKey},,,${attributeValue}**           | JSON-path expression, uses for creating data for sending to FTP server, if methodFilter equal to write. If methodFilter is equal to read, this field will be passing.                 |
|---

This section in configuration file looks like:

```json
"serverSideRpc": [
  {
    "deviceNameFilter": ".*",
    "methodFilter": "read",
    "valueExpression": "${params}"
  },
  {
    "deviceNameFilter": ".*",
    "methodFilter": "write",
    "valueExpression": "${params}"
  }
]
```
