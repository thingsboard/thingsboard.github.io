To understand how this connector works, we will describe how to connect device Xiaomi Mi Smart Temperature Humidity Sensor to ThingsBoard using gateway.
We know following device parameters:
Device **MAC address** - 4C:65:A8:DF:85:C0
Default name characteristic id -  00002A00-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB   - This is a default characteristic - we have got it ID from [GATT characeristics documentation](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/characteristics/)
Temperature characteristic id - 00002A00-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB    - This is a custom characteristic - we have got it after scanning device characteristics. 

Default configuration created for this device to process data from it, receive notifies and write some information.  

In a [main section](#main-section) we write general configuration for our connector, such as connector name scan interval, etc.  
In a [device subsection](#device-object-subsection) we write general configuration for connection to our device (name for device in ThingsBoard and device MAC address, etc.).  
In a [subsection telemetry](#subsection-telemetry) we write the configuration for processing data from the device (Where the gateway should take the data, method and converter will interpret this data to telemetry and attributes on ThingsBoard).  
In a [subsection attributeUpdates](#subsection-attributes) we write the configuration to rename the device after receiving attribute update request from ThingsBoard.  
If device shared attribute with a name "sharedName" changed - gateway will write data from this attribute to characteristic with ID - 00002A00-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB.  

### Main section
