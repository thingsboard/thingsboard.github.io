## Custom connector implementation

Connectors are Gateway components that connect to external system or directly to devices. Gateway has many built-in connectors (e.g. MQTT, OPC-UA server, Modbus, BLE, etc).
Once connected, connector is either poll data from those systems or subscribe to updates. Poll vs subscribe depends on the protocol capabilities.

Main goal of the custom connector is opportunity to connect to any device with any protocol. Connectors are written in Python language.
 
We will demonstrate how to create custom connector by example. Let's assume we want our connector to connect to serial port on your device and read the data. 
Connector will be able to push data to device over serial. We will call this connector SerialConnector. Please see step-by-step guide how to add SerialConnector to your Gateway.

Let's assume our serial devices push UTF-8 encoded strings like this: 

```text
422498
```
where 42 is temperature, 24 is humidity and 98 is battery level of the device and messages are separated by \n symbol.

### Step 1. Define SerialConnector configuration

TODO: Put example of connector configuration.

### Step 2. Locate extensions folder

Connector file should being placed in extensions folder that depends on type of installation:

**Ubuntu/CentOS:**

```bash
/var/lib/thingsboard_gateway/extensions
```

**For installation using pip:** 

```bash 
/usr/lib/python3/site-packages/thingsboard_gateway/extensions
```
or

```bash
/usr/.local/lib/python3/site-packages/thingsboard_gateway/extensions
```

### Step 3. Define Connector Implementation

The custom connector should inherit from CustomConnector class.  
Connector base class inherits from threading.Thread and have methods of this class.

### Step 5. Define Converter Implementation

See separate guide. TODO: link.

### Step 6. Include Connector into main Gateway configuration file

TODO

## Custom connector methods reference

You should implement following methods:  
**\_\_init\_\_** -- called on creating object (In example used for loading converters, saving data from configs to object variables and creating serial ports objects).  
**run** -- Main method of thread, must contain an infinite loop and all calls to data receiving/processing functions.  
**close** -- method, that has being called when gateway stops and should contain processing of closing connection/ports etc.  
**on_attributes_update** -- gateway call it when receives AttributeUpdates request from ThingsBoard server to device with this connector.  
**server_side_rpc** -- gateway call it when receives ServerRpcRequest from ThingsBoard server.  

##### \_\_init\_\_ method

**Parameters:**

```python
def __init__(self, gateway, config, connector_type):
```

*self* -- current object  
*gateway* -- gateway object (will being used for saving data)   
*config* -- dictionary with data from connector configuration file   
*connector_type* -- type of connector(Need for load converters for this connector type, from tb_gateway.yaml)   

In example above, we used this method to initialize data with which we will work.  


##### run method

Method from threading module, that being called after initializing of gateway. 

**Parameters:**

```python
def run(self):
```
*self* -- current object.  


In example above we use this method for connection to devices, read data from them and run converter

##### close method

Method is being called when gateway stopping or catch a fatal exception in a main loop of gateway.

```python
def close(self):
```
*self* -- current object.  

##### on_attributes_update method

Method is being called when gateway receive AttributeUpdates request from ThingsBoard.  

```python
def on_attributes_update_method(self, content):
```
*self* -- current object.  
*content* -- dictionary with data from ThingsBoard server.  


##### server_side_rpc_handler

Method is being called when gateway receive AttributeUpdates request from ThingsBoard.  

```python
def server_side_rpc_handler(self, content):
```
*self* -- current object.  
*content* -- dictionary with data from ThingsBoard server.  

Example of content:

```python
{"device": "CustomSerialDevice1", "data": {"id": 1, "method": "toggle_gpio", "params": {"pin":1}}}
```

There are 2 types of rpc requests processing available - with response and without it.  

After processing request you should just use following gateway method:  
```python 
self.__gateway.send_rpc_reply(device, req_id, content)
```
Where:  
*device* - String with device name.  
*req_id* - Id of RPC request from ThingsBoard  
*content* - depends on type of rpc:  
 - If without response:
 
 ```python
content = {"success": True}
```
  
 - If with response in content should be any dictionary with content that you want send to ThingsBoard as response.
