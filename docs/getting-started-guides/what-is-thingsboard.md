See [**ThingsBoard features list**](/docs/#community-edition-features) for more features and useful links to the specific feature documentation. 

#### Architecture

ThingsBoard is designed to be:

* **scalable**: horizontally scalable platform, build using leading open-source technologies.
* **fault-tolerant**: no single-point-of-failure, every node in the cluster is identical.
* **robust and efficient**: single server node can handle tens or even hundreds thousands of devices depending on use-case. 
ThingsBoard cluster can handle millions of devices.
* **customizable**: adding new functionality is easy with customizable widgets and rule engine nodes.
* **durable**: never lose your data.

See [**ThingsBoard Architecture**](/docs/reference) for more details.
