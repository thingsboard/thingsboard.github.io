ThingsBoard is an open-source IoT platform that enables rapid development, management and scaling of IoT projects.

With ThingsBoard, you are able to:

 - Provision and control devices.
 - Collect and visualize data from devices.
 - Analyze device data and trigger alarms with complex event processing.
 - Deliver device data to other systems.
 - Build workflows based on device life-cycle event, REST API event, RPC request, etc
 - Enable use-case specific features using customizable rule chains.  

Our goal is to provide the out-of-the-box IoT cloud or on-premises solution that will enable server-side infrastructure for your IoT applications.

#### ThingsBoard is:

* **scalable**: horizontally scalable platform, build using leading open-source technologies.
* **fault-tolerant**: no single-point-of-failure, every node in the cluster is identical.
* **robust and efficient**: single server node can handle tens or even hundreds thousands of devices depending on use-case. 
ThingsBoard cluster can handle millions of devices.
* **customizable**: adding new functionality is easy with customizable widgets and rule engine nodes.
* **durable**: never lose your data.

See [ThingsBoard Architecture](/docs/reference/architecture) for more details.

**Note** You can also connect **existing** devices to the platform using **[ThingsBoard Gateway](/docs/iot-gateway/what-is-iot-gateway/)**.
