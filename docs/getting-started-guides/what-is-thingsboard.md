ThingsBoard is an open-source IoT platform that enables rapid development, management, and scaling of IoT projects. 
Our goal is to provide the out-of-the-box IoT cloud or on-premises solution that will enable server-side infrastructure for your IoT applications. 

#### Features

With ThingsBoard, you are able to:

 - Provision devices, assets and customers, and define relations between them.
 - Collect and visualize data from devices and assets. 
 - Analyze incoming telemetry and trigger alarms with complex event processing.
 - Control your devices using remote procedure calls (RPC).
 - Build work-flows based on a device life-cycle event, REST API event, RPC request, etc.
 - Design dynamic and responsive dashboards and present device or asset telemetry  and insights to your customers.  
 - Enable use-case specific features using customizable rule chains.
 - Push device data to other systems.
 - Much more...

#### Architecture

ThingsBoard is designed to be:

* **scalable**: the horizontally scalable platform, built using leading open-source technologies.
* **fault-tolerant**: no single-point-of-failure, every node in the cluster is identical.
* **robust and efficient**: a single server node can handle tens or even hundreds of thousands of devices, depending on the use-case. 
ThingsBoard cluster can handle millions of devices.
* **customizable**: adding new functionality is easy with customizable widgets and rule engine nodes.
* **durable**: never lose your data.

See [**ThingsBoard Architecture**](/docs/reference) for more details.
