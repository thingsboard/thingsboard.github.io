This guide will help you to install and start standalone TBMQ using Docker on Linux or macOS.
If you are looking for a cluster installation instruction, please visit [cluster setup page](/docs/mqtt-broker/install/cluster/docker-compose-setup/).

## Prerequisites

To run TBMQ on a single machine you will need at least 2Gb of RAM.

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

{% include templates/install/docker-install-note.md %}

## Installation

Execute the following commands to download the script that will install and start TBMQ:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingsboard/tbmq/{{ site.release.broker_branch }}/msa/tbmq/configs/tbmq-install-and-run.sh &&
sudo chmod +x tbmq-install-and-run.sh && ./tbmq-install-and-run.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

The script downloads the _docker-compose.yml_ file, creates necessary docker volumes, installs the database for TBMQ, and starts TBMQ.
Key configuration points for TBMQ in docker-compose file:

- `8083:8083` - connect local port 8083 to exposed internal HTTP port 8083;
- `1883:1883` - connect local port 1883 to exposed internal MQTT port 1883;
- `8084:8084` - connect local port 8084 to exposed internal MQTT over WebSockets port 8084;
- `tbmq-redis-data:/bitnami/redis/data` - maps the `tbmq-redis-data` volume to TBMQ Redis database data directory;
- `tbmq-postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data` - maps the `tbmq-postgres-data` volume to TBMQ Postgres database data directory;
- `tbmq-kafka-data:/bitnami/kafka` - maps the `tbmq-kafka-data` volume to Kafka data directory;
- `tbmq-logs:/var/log/thingsboard-mqtt-broker` - maps the `tbmq-logs` volume to TBMQ logs directory;
- `tbmq-data:/data` - maps the `tbmq-data` volume to TBMQ data directory that contains _.firstlaunch_ file after the DB is installed;
- `tbmq` - friendly local name of this machine;
- `restart: always` - automatically start TBMQ in case of system reboot and restart in case of failure;
- `SECURITY_MQTT_BASIC_ENABLED: "true"` - enables MQTT basic security. **Note**: by default security is disabled.

**Note**: In case the TBMQ is being installed on the same host where ThingsBoard is already running, the following issue can be seen:

```
Error response from daemon: ... Bind for 0.0.0.0:1883 failed: port is already allocated
```

In order to fix this, you need to expose another host's port for the TBMQ container,
i.e. change the `1883:1883` line in the downloaded docker-compose.yml file with, for example, `1889:1883`. After that re-run the script.

```shell
./tbmq-install-and-run.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

Once the installation process is complete you can access TBMQ UI by visiting the following URL `http://{your-host-ip}:8083` in your browser (e.g. **http://localhost:8083**).

{% include templates/mqtt-broker/login.md %}

## Logs, stop and start commands

In case of any issues you can examine service logs for errors.
For example to see TBMQ logs execute the following command:

```
docker compose logs -f tbmq
```
{: .copy-code}

To stop the containers:

```
docker compose stop
```
{: .copy-code}

To start the containers:

```
docker compose start
```
{: .copy-code}

## Upgrading

Review the [release notes](/docs/mqtt-broker/releases/) and [upgrade instruction](/docs/mqtt-broker/install/upgrade-instructions/) 
for detailed information on the latest changes.

### Backup and restore (Optional)

While backing up your PostgreSQL database is highly recommended, it is optional before proceeding with the upgrade. 
For further guidance, follow the [next instructions](https://github.com/thingsboard/tbmq/blob/main/msa/tbmq/configs/README.md).

### Upgrade to 2.0.0

For the TBMQ 2.0.0 release, the installation scripts have been updated to include Redis configuration.

Please update your `docker-compose.yml` file to incorporate the Redis settings. 
You can review the necessary changes by visiting the following [link](https://github.com/thingsboard/tbmq/pull/142/files#diff-18a10097b03fb393429353a8f84ba29498e9b72a21326deb9809865d384e2800).

Here is the complete docker compose file with the Redis configuration prior to the upgrade:

Additionally, add the following line to your `tbmq-install-and-run.sh` script (locate `create_volume_if_not_exists` lines) to create a volume for Redis data:

```bash
create_volume_if_not_exists tbmq-redis-data
```
{: .copy-code}

Or simply create it with the following command:

```bash
docker volume create tbmq-redis-data
```
{: .copy-code}

Once this is done, run the script to apply the changes:

```bash
./tbmq-install-and-run.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

This will restart TBMQ with Redis enabled. Afterward, you can proceed with the upgrade process.
Please [contact us](https://github.com/thingsboard/tbmq/issues), so we can answer any questions and provide our help if needed.

### Upgrade to 1.3.0

{% include templates/mqtt-broker/install/migration.md %}

### Run upgrade

In order to update to the latest version, execute the following commands:

```shell
wget -O tbmq-upgrade.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingsboard/tbmq/{{ site.release.broker_branch }}/msa/tbmq/configs/tbmq-upgrade.sh &&
sudo chmod +x tbmq-upgrade.sh && ./tbmq-upgrade.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

**NOTE**: replace `redis_url`, `db_url`, `db_username`, and `db_password` variables in the script with the corresponding values used during DB initialization.
