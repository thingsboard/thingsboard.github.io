This guide will help you to set up TBMQ in cluster mode using Minikube.

## Prerequisites

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
If you don't have Minikube installed, please follow [these instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/).
Additionally, you will need [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to be installed.

## Step 1. Clone TBMQ repository

```bash
git clone -b {{ site.release.broker_branch }} https://github.com/thingsboard/tbmq.git
cd tbmq/k8s/minikube
```
{: .copy-code}

## Step 2. Installation

To install TBMQ execute the following command:

```bash
./k8s-install-tbmq.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

## Step 3. Running

Execute the following command to deploy TBMQ:

```bash
./k8s-deploy-tbmq.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

After a while when all resources will be successfully started you can open `http://{your-cluster-ip}:30001` in your browser (e.g. **http://192.168.49.2:30001**).
You can check your cluster IP using command:
```bash
minikube ip
```
{: .copy-code}

{% include templates/mqtt-broker/login.md %}

## Step 4. Logs, delete statefulsets and services

In case of any issues, you can examine service logs for errors.
For example to see TBMQ node logs execute the following commands:

1) Get the list of the running tb-broker pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=tb-broker
```
{: .copy-code}

2) Fetch logs of the tb-broker pod:

```bash
kubectl logs -f TB_BROKER_POD_NAME
```
{: .copy-code}

Where:

- `TB_BROKER_POD_NAME` - tb-broker pod name obtained from the list of the running tb-broker pods.

Or use the next command to see the state of all the pods.
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
{: .copy-code}

Use the next command to see the state of all the services.
```bash
kubectl get services
```
{: .copy-code}

Use the next command to see the state of all the deployments.
```bash
kubectl get deployments
```
{: .copy-code}

Use the next command to see the state of all the statefulsets.
```bash
kubectl get statefulsets
```
{: .copy-code}

See [kubectl Cheat Sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) command reference for more details.

Execute the following command to delete TBMQ nodes:

```bash
./k8s-delete-tbmq.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

Execute the following command to delete all resources (including database):

```bash
./k8s-delete-all.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

## Upgrading

{% include templates/mqtt-broker/upgrade/upgrading.md %}

### Backup and restore (Optional)

While backing up your PostgreSQL database is highly recommended, it is optional before proceeding with the upgrade.
For further guidance, follow the [next instructions](https://github.com/thingsboard/tbmq/blob/main/k8s/minikube/backup-restore/README.md).

### Upgrade to 2.1.0

{% include templates/mqtt-broker/upgrade/update-to-2.1.0-release-cluster.md %}

### Run upgrade

In case you would like to upgrade, please pull the recent changes from the latest release branch:

```bash
git pull origin {{ site.release.broker_branch }}
```
{: .copy-code}

{% include templates/mqtt-broker/upgrade/upgrade-to-custom-release.md %}

**Note**: Make sure custom changes of yours if available are not lost during the merge process.

{% include templates/mqtt-broker/install/upgrade-hint.md %}

After that, execute the following command:

{% capture tabspec %}tbmq-upgrade
tbmq-upgrade-without-from-version,Since v2.1.0,shell,resources/upgrade-options/k8s-upgrade-tbmq-without-from-version.sh,/docs/mqtt-broker/install/cluster/resources/upgrade-options/k8s-upgrade-tbmq-without-from-version.sh

{% include tabs.html %}
