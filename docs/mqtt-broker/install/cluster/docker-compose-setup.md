This guide will help you to set up TBMQ in cluster mode using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

{% include templates/install/docker-install-note.md %}

## Step 1. Pull TBMQ Image

Make sure your have [logged in](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/) to docker hub using command line.

```bash
docker pull thingsboard/tbmq-node:{{ site.release.broker_full_ver }}
```
{: .copy-code}

## Step 2. Clone TBMQ repository

```bash
git clone -b {{ site.release.broker_branch }} https://github.com/thingsboard/tbmq.git
cd tbmq/docker
```
{: .copy-code}

## Step 3. Installation

Execute the following command to create necessary volumes for all the services and to update the haproxy config in the created volume.

```bash
./scripts/docker-create-volumes.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

Execute the following command to run installation:

```bash
./scripts/docker-install-tbmq.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

## Step 4. Running

Execute the following command to start services:

```bash
./scripts/docker-start-services.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

After a while when all services will be successfully started you can make requests to `http://{your-host-ip}:8083` 
in you browser (e.g. **http://localhost:8083**) and connect clients using MQTT protocol on 1883 port.

{% include templates/mqtt-broker/login.md %}

## Step 5. Logs, stop and start commands

In case of any issues you can examine service logs for errors.
For example to see TBMQ logs execute the following command:

```bash
docker compose logs -f tbmq1
```
{: .copy-code}

Or use the following command to see the state of all the containers.
```bash
docker compose ps
```
{: .copy-code}
Use next command to inspect the logs of all running services.
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```
{: .copy-code}
See [docker compose logs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/logs/) command reference for more details.

Execute the following command to stop services:

```bash
./scripts/docker-stop-services.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

Execute the following command to stop and completely remove deployed docker containers:

```bash
./scripts/docker-remove-services.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

In case you want to remove docker volumes for all the containers, execute the following command.
**Note:** it will remove all your data, so be careful before executing it.

```bash
./scripts/docker-remove-volumes.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

It could be useful to update logs (enable DEBUG/TRACE logs) in runtime or change TBMQ or Haproxy configs. In order to do
this you need to make changes, for example, to the
_haproxy.cfg_ or _logback.xml_ file.
Afterward, execute the next command to apply the changes for the container:

```bash
./scripts/docker-refresh-config.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

## Upgrading

Review the [release notes](/docs/mqtt-broker/releases/) and [upgrade instruction](/docs/mqtt-broker/install/upgrade-instructions/)
for detailed information on the latest changes.

### Backup and restore (Optional)

While backing up your PostgreSQL database is highly recommended, it is optional before proceeding with the upgrade.
For further guidance, follow the [next instructions](https://github.com/thingsboard/tbmq/blob/main/docker/backup-restore/README.md).

### Upgrade to 1.3.0

{% include templates/mqtt-broker/install/migration.md %}

### Run upgrade

In case you would like to upgrade, please pull the recent changes from the latest release branch:

```bash
git pull origin {{ site.release.broker_branch }}
```
{: .copy-code}

**Note**: Make sure custom changes of yours if available are not lost during the merge process. 
Make sure `TBMQ_VERSION` in .env file is set to the target version (e.g., set it to {{ site.release.broker_full_ver }} if you are upgrading to the latest).

{% include templates/mqtt-broker/install/upgrade-hint.md %}

After that execute the following commands:

```bash
./scripts/docker-stop-services.sh
./scripts/docker-upgrade-tbmq.sh --fromVersion=FROM_VERSION
./scripts/docker-start-services.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

Where `FROM_VERSION` - from which version upgrade should be started. 
See [Upgrade Instructions](/docs/mqtt-broker/install/upgrade-instructions/) for valid `fromVersion` values.

## Generate certificate for HTTPS

We are using HAproxy for proxying traffic to containers and for web UI by default we are using 8083 and 443 ports. 
For using HTTPS with a valid certificate, execute these commands:

```bash
docker exec haproxy-certbot certbot-certonly --domain your_domain --email your_email
docker exec haproxy-certbot haproxy-refresh
```
{: .copy-code}

**Note**: Valid certificate is used only when you visit web UI by domain in URL.
