This guide will help you to download and build TBMQ from sources. Instructions listed below are tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Required tools

This section contains installation instructions for build tools.

### Java

TBMQ is build using Java 17. Follow these instructions to install OpenJDK 17:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
```
{: .copy-code}

Please don't forget to configure your operating system to use OpenJDK 17 by default.
You can configure which version is the default using the following command:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```
{: .copy-code}

You can check the installation using the following command:

```bash
java -version
```
{: .copy-code}

Expected command output is:

```text
openjdk version "17.0.xx"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (...)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build ...)
```

### Maven

TBMQ build requires Maven 3.6.3+.

```bash
sudo apt install maven
```
{: .copy-code}

**Please note** that maven installation may set Java 7 as a default JVM on certain Linux machines. 
Use java installation [instructions](#java) to fix this. 

## Source code

You can clone source code of the project from the official [GitHub repo](https://github.com/thingsboard/tbmq).

```bash
git clone -b {{ site.release.broker_branch }} https://github.com/thingsboard/tbmq.git
cd tbmq
```
{: .copy-code}

## Build

Run the following command from the TBMQ folder to build the project:

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
{: .copy-code}

## Build local docker images

Make sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed.

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests -Ddockerfile.skip=false
```
{: .copy-code}

## Build artifacts

You can find debian, rpm and windows packages in the target folder:
 
```bash
cd application/target
```
{: .copy-code}

## Running tests

We are using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to run all kind of integration and black-box tests.

Please, manage [Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) to run tests properly.

Main and release branches are already tested, so you can skip tests and avoid installing docker as well.

Run all unit and integration tests:

```bash
mvn clean install
```
{: .copy-code}

## Tips and tricks

TBMQ is quite easy to build from sources on a brand-new clear environment.

Here are some tips and tricks to boost build experience: 

- [clean maven cache](https://www.baeldung.com/maven-clear-cache)
  ```bash
  rm -rf ~/.m2/repository
  ```
  {: .copy-code}

- clean gradle cache
  ```bash
  rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches/
  ```
  {: .copy-code}

- clean node modules
  ```bash
  rm -rf ui-ngx/node_modules
  ```
  {: .copy-code}

- build in parallel, format headers, build docker images
  ```bash
  mvn -T 0.8C license:format clean install -DskipTests -Ddockerfile.skip=false
  ```
  {: .copy-code}
