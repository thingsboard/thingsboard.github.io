---

TBMQ provides dedicated Private Cloud plans based on the **pay-as-you-go** model.

### Limits

Please see table below to compare the limits of the Private Cloud plans. The values are monthly limits, unless stated otherwise.

          <td>Maximum number of client sessions managed by the broker, including both active connections and persistent sessions that are temporarily disconnected but still maintained by the broker for quick reconnection. 
Once a session is expired or explicitly removed, it no longer counts toward the session limit and the slot becomes available for a new session</td>

          <td>Total throughput of messages processed per second, including both incoming and outgoing `MQTT_PUBLISH` packets. 
It does not include acknowledgment packets used in QoS 1 and 2 flows (such as `PUBACK`, `PUBREC`, etc.), nor other MQTT control packets like `CONNECT`, `SUBSCRIBE`, `UNSUBSCRIBE`, etc.</td>

          <td>Monthly traffic refers to the total amount of data transmitted through the TBMQ broker, including both incoming and outgoing MQTT messages.
Traffic is measured as the sum of all MQTT packet payloads sent and received by clients. If the monthly allowance is exceeded, additional usage is billed at $0.15 per GB</td>
