In TBMQ 1.x, persistent DEVICE clients relied on PostgreSQL for message persistence and retrieval, 
ensuring that messages were delivered when a client reconnected. 
While PostgreSQL performed well initially, it had a fundamental limitation — it could only scale vertically. 
We anticipated that as the number of persistent MQTT sessions grew, PostgreSQL’s architecture would eventually become a bottleneck. 
To address this, we explored more scalable alternatives capable of handling the increasing demands of our MQTT broker. 
Redis was quickly chosen as the best fit due to its horizontal scalability, native clustering support, and widespread adoption.

## Postgres Usage and Limitations

To fully understand the reasoning behind this shift, it’s important to first examine how MQTT clients operated within the PostgreSQL architecture. This architecture was built around two key tables.

The `device_session_ctx` table was responsible for maintaining the session state of each persistent MQTT client:

```postgresql
                      Table "public.device_session_ctx"
       Column       |          Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default 
--------------------+------------------------+-----------+----------+---------
 client_id          | character varying(255) |           | not null | 
 last_updated_time  | bigint                 |           | not null | 
 last_serial_number | bigint                 |           |          | 
 last_packet_id     | integer                |           |          | 
Indexes:
    "device_session_ctx_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (client_id)
```

The key columns are `last_packet_id` and `last_serial_number`, which is used to maintain message order for persistent MQTT clients:

 - `last_packet_id` represents the packet ID of the last MQTT message received.
 - `last_serial_number` acts as a continuously increasing counter, preventing message order issues when the MQTT packet ID wraps around after reaching its limit of `65535`.

The `device_publish_msg` table was responsible for storing messages that must be published to persistent MQTT clients (subscribers).

```postgresql
                         Table "public.device_publish_msg"
          Column          |          Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default 
--------------------------+------------------------+-----------+----------+---------
 client_id                | character varying(255) |           | not null | 
 serial_number            | bigint                 |           | not null | 
 topic                    | character varying      |           | not null | 
 time                     | bigint                 |           | not null | 
 packet_id                | integer                |           |          | 
 packet_type              | character varying(255) |           |          | 
 qos                      | integer                |           | not null | 
 payload                  | bytea                  |           | not null | 
 user_properties          | character varying      |           |          | 
 retain                   | boolean                |           |          | 
 msg_expiry_interval      | integer                |           |          | 
 payload_format_indicator | integer                |           |          | 
 content_type             | character varying(255) |           |          | 
 response_topic           | character varying(255) |           |          | 
 correlation_data         | bytea                  |           |          | 
Indexes:
    "device_publish_msg_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (client_id, serial_number)
    "idx_device_publish_msg_packet_id" btree (client_id, packet_id)
```

The key columns to highlight:

 - `time` – captures the system time (timestamp) when the message is stored. This field is used for periodic cleanup of expired messages.
 - `msg_expiry_interval` – represents the expiration time (in seconds) for a message. 
 This is set only for incoming MQTT 5.0 messages that include an expiry property. 
 If the expiry property is absent, the message does not have a specific expiration time and remains valid until it is removed by time or size-based cleanup.

Together, these tables managed message persistence and session state. 
The `device_session_ctx` table was designed for fast retrieval of the last MQTT packet ID and serial number stored for each persistent MQTT client. 
When messages for a client are received from a shared Kafka topic, the broker queries this table to fetch the latest values. 
These values are incremented sequentially and assigned to each message before being saved to the `device_publish_msg` table.

While this design ensured reliable message delivery, it also introduced performance constraints.
Based on the TimescaleDB blog [post](https://www.timescale.com/blog/postgresql-timescaledb-1000x-faster-queries-90-data-compression-and-much-more#ingest-performance) 
vanilla PostgreSQL can handle up to 300k inserts per second under ideal conditions. 
However, this performance depends on factors such as hardware, workload, and table schema. 
While vertical scaling can provide some improvement, PostgreSQL’s per-table insert throughput eventually reaches a hard limit.

## Redis as a Scalable Alternative

Our decision to migrate to Redis was driven by its ability to address the core performance bottlenecks encountered with PostgreSQL. 
Unlike PostgreSQL, which relies on disk-based storage and vertical scaling, Redis operates primarily in memory, significantly reducing read and write latency.
Additionally, Redis’s distributed architecture allows TBMQ to scale horizontally, keeping the retrieval and delivery of persistent messages efficient even as the number of client sessions and stored messages grows.

With these benefits in mind, we started our migration process with an evaluation of data structures that could preserve the functionality of the PostgreSQL approach
while aligning with Redis Cluster constraints to enable efficient horizontal scaling. 
This also presented an opportunity to improve certain aspects of the original design, such as periodic cleanups, by leveraging Redis features like built-in expiration mechanisms.

### Redis Cluster Constraints

When migrating from PostgreSQL to Redis, we recognized that replicating the existing data model would require multiple Redis data structures to efficiently handle message persistence and ordering. 
This, in turn, meant using multiple keys for each persistent MQTT Client session.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="redis-cluster-constraints" %}

Redis Cluster distributes data across multiple slots to enable horizontal scaling. 
However, multi-key operations must access keys within the same slot. 
If the keys reside in different slots, the operation triggers a cross-slot error, preventing the command from executing. 
We used the persistent MQTT client ID as a [hash tag](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec/#hash-tags) in our key names to address this. 
By enclosing the client ID in curly braces `{}`, Redis ensures that all keys for the same client are hashed to the same slot. 
This guarantees that related data for each client stays together, allowing multi-key operations to proceed without errors.

### Atomic Operations via Lua Scripts

Consistency is critical in a high-throughput environment like TBMQ, where many messages can arrive simultaneously for the same MQTT client. 
Hashtagging helps to avoid cross-slot errors, but without atomic operations, there is a risk of race conditions or partial updates. 
This could lead to message loss or incorrect ordering. It is important to make sure that operations updating the keys for the same MQTT client are atomic.

Redis is designed to execute individual commands atomically. 
However, in our case, we need to update multiple data structures as part of a single operation for each MQTT client. 
Executing these sequentially without atomicity opens the door to inconsistencies if another process modifies the same data in between commands. 
That’s where [Lua scripting](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/programmability/eval-intro/) comes in. Lua script executes as a single, isolated unit. 
During script execution, no other commands can run concurrently, ensuring that the operations inside the script happen atomically.

Based on this information, we decided that for any operation, such as saving messages or retrieving undelivered messages upon reconnection, we will execute a separate Lua script. 
This ensures that all operations within a single Lua script reside in the same hash slot, maintaining atomicity and consistency.

### Redis Data Structures

One of the key requirements of the migration was maintaining message order, a task previously handled by the `serial_number` column in PostgreSQL’s `device_publish_msg` table. 
After evaluating various Redis data structures, we determined that [sorted sets](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/sorted-sets/) (ZSETs) were the ideal replacement.

Redis sorted sets naturally organize data by score, enabling quick retrieval of messages in ascending or descending order. 
While sorted sets provided an efficient way to maintain message order, storing full message payloads directly in sorted sets led to excessive memory usage. 
Redis does not support per-member TTL within sorted sets. As a result, messages persisted indefinitely unless explicitly removed. 
Similar to PostgreSQL, we had to perform periodic cleanups using `ZREMRANGEBYSCORE` to delete expired messages. 
This operation carries a complexity of `O(log N + M)`, where `M` is the number of elements removed. 
To overcome this limitation, we decided to store message payloads using strings data structure while storing in the sorted set references to these keys.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="redis-data-structures" %}

In the image above, you can see that each key follows the pattern `{client_id}_messages`,
where `client_id` is a placeholder for the actual client ID,
while the curly braces `{}` around it are added to create a hashtag.
Also, you may notice that the score continues to grow even when the MQTT packet ID wraps around. 

Let’s take a closer look at the details illustrated in this image. 
At first, the reference for the message with the MQTT packet ID equal to `65534` was added to the sorted set:

```bash
ZADD {client_id}_messages 65534 {client_id}_messages_65534
```
{: .copy-code}

Here, `{client_id}_messages` is the sorted set key name, where `{client_id}` acts as a hashtag derived from the persistent MQTT client’s unique ID. 
The suffix `_messages` is a constant added to each sorted set key name for consistency. 
Following the sorted set key name, the score value `65534` corresponds to the MQTT packet ID of the message received by the client. 
Finally, we see the reference key that points to the actual payload of the MQTT message. 
Similar to the sorted set key, the message reference key uses the MQTT client’s ID as a hashtag, followed by the `_messages` suffix and the MQTT packet ID value.

In the next iteration, we add the message reference for the MQTT message with a packet ID equal to `65535` into the sorted set. This is the maximum packet ID, as the range is limited to `65535`.

```bash
ZADD {client_id}_messages 65535 {client_id}_messages_65535
```
{: .copy-code}

So at the next iteration MQTT packet ID should be equal to `1`, while the score should continue to grow and be equal to `65536`.

```bash
ZADD {client_id}_messages 65536 {client_id}_messages_1
```
{: .copy-code}

This approach ensures that the message’s references will be properly ordered in the sorted set regardless of the packet ID’s limited range.

Message payloads are stored as string values with `SET` commands that support expiration `(EX)`, providing `O(1)` complexity for writes and `TTL` applications:

```bash
SET {client_id}_messages_1 "{
  \"packetType\":\"PUBLISH\",
  \"payload\":\"eyJkYXRhIjoidGJtcWlzYXdlc29tZSJ9\",
  \"time\":1736333110026,
  \"clientId\":\"client\",
  \"retained\":false,
  \"packetId\":1,
  \"topicName\":\"europe/ua/kyiv/client/0\",
  \"qos\":1
}" EX 600
```
{: .copy-code}

Another benefit aside from efficient updates and `TTL` applications is that the message payloads can be retrieved:

```bash
GET {client_id}_messages_1
```
{: .copy-code}

or removed:

```bash
DEL {client_id}_messages_1
```
{: .copy-code}

with constant complexity `O(1)` without affecting the sorted set structure.

Another very important element of our Redis architecture is the use of a string key to store the last MQTT packet ID processed:

```bash
GET {client_id}_last_packet_id
"1"
```
{: .copy-code}

This approach serves the same purpose as in the PostgreSQL solution. 
When a client reconnects, the server must determine the correct packet ID to assign to the next message that will be saved in Redis. 
Initially, we considered using the sorted set’s highest score as a reference. 
However, since there are scenarios where the sorted set could be empty or completely removed, 
we concluded that the most reliable solution is to store the last packet ID separately.

### Managing Sorted Set Size Dynamically

This hybrid approach, leveraging sorted sets and string data structures, eliminates the need for periodic cleanups based on time, as per-message TTLs are now applied. 
In addition, following the PostgreSQL design we needed to address somehow the cleanup of the sorted set based on the messages limit set in the configuration.

```yaml
# Maximum number of PUBLISH messages stored for each persisted DEVICE client
limit: "${MQTT_PERSISTENT_SESSION_DEVICE_PERSISTED_MESSAGES_LIMIT:10000}"
```
{: .copy-code}

This limit is an important part of our design, allowing us to control and predict the memory allocation required for each persistent MQTT client. 
For example, a client might connect, triggering the registration of a persistent session, and then rapidly disconnect. 
In such scenarios, it is essential to ensure that the number of messages stored for the client (while waiting for a potential reconnection) remains within the defined limit, preventing unbounded memory usage.

```java
if (messagesLimit > 0xffff) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Persisted messages limit can't be greater than 65535!");
}
```
{: .copy-code}

To reflect the natural constraints of the MQTT protocol, the maximum number of persisted messages for individual clients is set to `65535`.

To handle this within the Redis solution, we implemented dynamic management of the sorted set’s size. 
When new messages are added, the sorted set is trimmed to ensure the total number of messages remains within the desired limit, and the associated strings are also cleaned up to free up memory.

```lua
-- Get the number of elements to be removed
local numElementsToRemove = redis.call('ZCARD', messagesKey) - maxMessagesSize
-- Check if trimming is needed
if numElementsToRemove > 0 then
    -- Get the elements to be removed (oldest ones)
    local trimmedElements = redis.call('ZRANGE', messagesKey, 0, numElementsToRemove - 1)
    -- Iterate over the elements and remove them
    for _, key in ipairs(trimmedElements) do
        -- Remove the message from the string data structure
        redis.call('DEL', key)
        -- Remove the message reference from the sorted set
        redis.call('ZREM', messagesKey, key)
    end
end
```
{: .copy-code}

### Message Retrieval and Cleanup

Our design not only ensures dynamic size management during the persistence of new messages but also supports cleanup during message retrieval, 
which occurs when a device reconnects to process undelivered messages. 
This approach keeps the sorted set clean by removing references to expired messages.

```lua
-- Define the sorted set key
local messagesKey = KEYS[1]
-- Define the maximum allowed number of messages
local maxMessagesSize = tonumber(ARGV[1])
-- Get all elements from the sorted set
local elements = redis.call('ZRANGE', messagesKey, 0, -1)
-- Initialize a table to store retrieved messages
local messages = {}
-- Iterate over each element in the sorted set
for _, key in ipairs(elements) do
    -- Check if the message key still exists in Redis
    if redis.call('EXISTS', key) == 1 then
        -- Retrieve the message value from Redis
        local msgJson = redis.call('GET', key)
        -- Store the retrieved message in the result table
        table.insert(messages, msgJson)
    else
        -- Remove the reference from the sorted set if the key does not exist
        redis.call('ZREM', messagesKey, key)
    end
end
-- Return the retrieved messages
return messages
```
{: .copy-code}

By leveraging Redis’ sorted sets and strings, along with Lua scripting for atomic operations, our new design achieves efficient message persistence and retrieval, as well as dynamic cleanup. 
This design addresses the scalability limitations of the PostgreSQL-based solution.

## Migration from Jedis to Lettuce

To validate the scalability of the new Redis-based architecture for persistent message storage, we selected a point-to-point (P2P) MQTT communication pattern as a performance testing scenario. 
Unlike fan-in (many-to-one) or fan-out (one-to-many) scenarios, the P2P pattern typically involves one-to-one communication and creates a new persistent session for each communicating pair. 
This makes it well-suited for evaluating how the system scales as the number of sessions grows.

Before starting large-scale tests, we conducted a prototype test that revealed the limit of 30k msg/s throughput when using PostgreSQL for persistence message storage. 
At the moment of migration to Redis, we used the Jedis library for Redis interactions, primarily for cache management. 
As a result, we initially decided to extend Jedis to handle message persistence for persistent MQTT clients. 
However, the initial results of the Redis implementation with Jedis were unexpected. 
While we anticipated Redis would significantly outperform PostgreSQL, the performance improvement was modest, reaching only 40k msg/s throughput compared to the 30k msg/s limit with PostgreSQL.

This led us to investigate the bottlenecks, where we discovered that Jedis was a limiting factor. 
While reliable, Jedis operate synchronously, processing each Redis command sequentially. 
This forces the system to wait for one operation to complete before executing the next. 
In high-throughput environments, this approach significantly limited Redis’s potential, preventing the full utilization of system resources.
To overcome this limitation, we migrated to [Lettuce](https://github.com/redis/lettuce), an asynchronous Redis client built on top of [Netty](https://github.com/netty/netty). 
With Lettuce, our throughput increased to 60k msg/s, demonstrating the benefits of non-blocking operations and improved parallelism.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="jedis-to-lettuce" %}

Lettuce allows multiple commands to be sent and processed in parallel, fully exploiting Redis’s capacity for concurrent workloads. 
Ultimately, the migration unlocked the performance gains we expected from Redis, paving the way for successful P2P testing at scale.
