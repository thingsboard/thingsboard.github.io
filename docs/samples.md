The Thingsboard samples are grouped by hardware platform. 

**Note** Thingsboard provides hardware independent APIs. 
If your device platform is not in the list, but is able to setup HTTP, CoAP or MQTT connections - it is possible to integrate it with Thingsboard.
Thingsboard team is working on samples applications for 
Intel Edison, C.H.I.P, Tessel, Samsung Artik and Gamalto 
and will upload them to this page as soon as possible.
