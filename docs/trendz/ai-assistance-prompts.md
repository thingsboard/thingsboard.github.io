* TOC
{:toc}

Prompt management in Trendz is a workspace where you define reusable prompt templates that combine your expert instructions with live telemetry data collected by ThingsBoard. From the dashboard you can trigger any template with a single click: 
Trendz automatically pulls the relevant device or asset metrics, injects them into your template, submits the assembled prompt to the configured language model, and then displays the modelâ€™s response directly alongside your telemetry. 
This lets you run AI-driven queries over real-time operational data without manually gathering data or retyping prompts.

## Prompts Tab

In this tab, you can check, create, rename, modify, or delete prompts.

To access the Prompts tab, you can follow these steps:
1. You can click on the ![image](/images/trendz/ai/overview-ai-assistance-icon.png) icon labeled *Assistant* located on the left side of the workspace.
2. You can then click on the *Prompts* tab located at the upper left side of the workspace.

### Markdown Tab

  LLM (Large Language Models) understand prompts in the Markdown format. This format makes prompts not only understandable for both humans and the model but also more structured.

  You can access the Markdown tab by editing or creating prompts (refer to the corresponding sections in the *Available Actions* section).

  The Markdown tab has the following functions:

* **Show Preview Button**

  You can split your screen into two sides: one for the Markdown code and the other for your prompt in a human-readable 
  format, by clicking the *Show Preview* button.

  To exit preview mode, you can click the *Hide Preview* button.

  {% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="trendz-prompts-markdown-preview" %}

* **Fullscreen Button**

  You can enter fullscreen mode in the Markdown tab by clicking the *Fullscreen* button in the upper right corner of the tab.

  To exit fullscreen mode, you can click the same button again.

  {% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="trendz-prompts-markdown-fullscreen" %}

* **Markdown Blocks**

  The Markdown tab supports various markdown blocks. In the upper left corner of the screen, you can find shortcuts for the following blocks:

  - Bold Text
  - Italic Text
  - H1 header
  - Reference
  - Link
  - Image
  - Unordered list
  - Ordered list
  - Code block

  You can learn more about *Markdown blocks* in the [GitHub tutorial](https://markdown-it.github.io/).

## Best practices

Creating effective prompts is key to getting accurate and meaningful responses from Large Language Models (LLMs). Here are some essential best practices:

* **Be Clear and Specific**  
  Ensure your prompt is clear and specific to avoid vague or ambiguous responses. The more detail you provide, the better the model can understand and respond accurately.

* **Use Natural Language**  
  Write prompts as you would speak to another person. This helps the model interpret your request and generate a natural-sounding response.

* **Leverage Markdown for Structure**  
  Use Markdown formatting to organize and structure your prompt. For example:

  - Use **bold** for emphasis
  - Use *italics* for subtle hints or notes
  - Include headers for clear topic segmentation  
    
  This not only helps the model interpret your request more effectively but also makes your prompt more readable.

* **Keep Prompts Concise**  
  While detail is important, keep your prompts concise. Too much information can overwhelm the model, leading to less focused responses.

* **Test and Refine**  
  Prompt creation is an iterative process. Test your prompts, review the responses, and refine them to improve accuracy and relevance.

By following these practices, you can create effective prompts that lead to better results from LLMs.
