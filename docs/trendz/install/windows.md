## Prerequisites

This guide describes how to install Trendz Analytics on a Windows machine.
Instructions below are provided for Windows 10/8.1/8/7 32-bit/64-bit. 

**Hardware requirements** depend on amount of analyzed data and amount of devices connected to the system. 
To run Trendz Analytics on a single machine you will need at least 1Gb of free RAM.

In small and medium installations Trendz can be installed **on the same** server with ThingsBoard.

## Step 1. Install Java 17 (OpenJDK) 

{% include templates/install/windows-java-install.md %}

## Step 2. Trendz Analytics service installation

Download and extract the package.

```bash
https://dist.thingsboard.io/trendz-windows-{{ site.release.trendz_ver }}.zip
```
{: .copy-code}

**Note:** We assume you have extracted Trendz package to default location: *C:\Program Files (x86)\trendz*  

## Step 3. Obtain and configure license key 

We assume you have already chosen subscription plan for Trendz and have license key. If not, please get your [Free Trial license](/pricing/?section=trendz-options&product=trendz-self-managed&solution=trendz-pay-as-you-go) before you proceed.
See [How-to get pay-as-you-go subscription](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK-QDFGxWek){:target="_blank"} for more details.

Once you get the license secret, you should put it to the trendz configuration file. 
Open the Notepad or other editor as administrator user (right click on the app icon and select "Run as administrator").  
Open the following file for editing (select "All Files" instead of "Text Documents" in file choosing dialog, the encoding is UTF-8):

```text 
C:\Program Files (x86)\trendz\conf\trendz.yml
``` 
{: .copy-code}

Scroll to the bottom of the file and locate the following configuration block:

```yml
license:
    secret: "${TRENDZ_LICENSE_SECRET:YOUR_LICENSE_SECRET_HERE}" # license secret obtained from ThingsBoard License Portal (https://license.thingsboard.io)
```

## Step 4. Configure connection with ThingsBoard Platform

You can connect Trendz Analytics to the ThingsBoard Community Edition or ThingsBoard Professional Edition.

Open the Notepad or other editor as administrator user (right click on the app icon and select "Run as administrator").  
Open the following file for editing (select "All Files" instead of "Text Documents" in file choosing dialog, the encoding is UTF-8):

```text
C:\Program Files (x86)\trendz\conf\trendz.yml
``` 
{: .copy-code}

Add ThingsBoard REST API URL that would be used for communicating with ThingsBoard Platform. In most cases, when Trendz installed
in the same server with ThingsBoard, API_URL would be **http://localhost:8080**. Otherwise you should use ThingsBoard domain name.

```bash
tb.api.url: "${TB_API_URL:http://localhost:8080}"
```
{: .copy-code}

## Step 5. Configure Trendz database
Trendz uses PostgreSQL as a database. You can install PostgreSQL on the same serverfor Trendz or use managed PostgreSQL 
service from your cloud vendor.

### PostgreSQL Installation

Download the installation file (PostgreSQL 12.17 or newer releases) [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads#windows) and follow the installation instructions.

During PostgreSQL installation, you will be prompted for superuser (postgres) password.
Don't forget this password. It will be used later. For simplicity, we will substitute it with "postgres".

### Create Database for Trendz

Once installed, launch the "pgAdmin" software and login as superuser (postgres). 
Open your server and create database "trendz" with owner "postgres".


### Configure database connection for Trendz

Open the Notepad or other editor as administrator user (right click on the app icon and select "Run as administrator").  
Open the following file for editing (select "All Files" instead of "Text Documents" in file choosing dialog, the encoding is UTF-8):

```text 
C:\Program Files (x86)\trendz\conf\trendz.yml
``` 
{: .copy-code}

and locate "datasource" block. Replace SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL, SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME and SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD
properties with valid values. Don't forget to replace "postgres" with your real postgres user password:

```yml
datasource:
    driverClassName: "${SPRING_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME:org.postgresql.Driver}"
    url: "${SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL:jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/trendz}"
    username: "${SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME:postgres}"
    password: "${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD:postgres}"
    hikari:
      maximumPoolSize: "${SPRING_DATASOURCE_MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE:5}"
``` 
{: .copy-code}

## Step 6. Install Trendz Python executor

There are two options for installing Python to execute the necessary scripts in Trendz.

**WARNING!**
Before proceeding, make sure that Python is **not installed** on your system in any form — standalone, via the Microsoft Store, or Chocolatey. Failing to do so may lead to unexpected results during the installation process. See the Troubleshooting section for details.

**WARNING!**
It is important to use a specific Python version — **3.11.0**. Newer versions do not have prebuilt dependencies and require building them from source, which can lead to errors during dependency installation.

### 1. Local environment

In this option, Python will be installed on your Windows user account, and the required modules will be installed in the user scope (not system-wide).

Follow the next steps:

* **Download and install Python**

Download and install Python 3.11.0 from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/).

Download the Windows installer (64-bit) file and run it. When you see this window, select all proposed checkboxes.
The administrator rights will be requested.

![image](/images/trendz/install/windows/windows-python-1.png)

Check the Python is installed by launching the command:

```shell
python --version
```
{: .copy-code}

You will output like this:

```text
Python 3.11.0
```

* **Install required python packages**

Create the requirements.txt file with the following content:

```text
numpy == 1.26.4
scikit-learn == 1.4.2
statsmodels == 0.14.2
tensorflow == 2.16.1
pandas == 2.1.4
matplotlib == 3.8.4
prophet == 1.1.5
xgboost == 2.0.3
```
{: .copy-code}

Run the command to install dependencies

```shell
pip install --user --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```
{: .copy-code}

* **Configure venv connection for Trendz**

Open in Notepad with Administrator rights the file “C:\Program Files (x86)\trendz\conf\trendz.yml” and locate the **“script-engine”** section.

Find the **“use-custom-venv”** field and replace **“false”** with **“true”**.
Find the **“custom-venv-path”** field and replace the **“/usr/bin/python3”** value with **“python”**.

### 2. Virtual environment (venv)

In this option, Python will still be installed on your user account, but we will also create a virtual environment to manage dependencies in isolation from other projects and the base Python installation.

Follow the next steps:

* **Download and install Python**

Download and install Python 3.11.0 from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/).

Check the Python is installed by launching the command:

```shell
python --version
```
{: .copy-code}

You will output like this:

```text
Python 3.11.0
```

* **Create python virtual environment (venv)**

Create a folder where the virtual environment will be stored. You can choose any path — for example, we place it in the same directory as Trendz: **C:\Program Files (x86)\trendz**

Open the command line **in the mentioned folder** and run:

```shell
py -3.11 -m venv venv
```
{: .copy-code}

* **Install required python packages**

Create the requirements.txt file with the following content:

```text
numpy == 1.26.4
scikit-learn == 1.4.2
statsmodels == 0.14.2
tensorflow == 2.16.1
pandas == 2.1.4
matplotlib == 3.8.4
prophet == 1.1.5
xgboost == 2.0.3
```
{: .copy-code}

Run the command to install dependencies:

```shell
.\venv\Scripts\pip.exe install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```
{: .copy-code}

Open in Notepad with Administrator rights the file “C:\Program Files (x86)\trendz\conf\trendz.yml” and locate the **“script-engine”** section.

Find the **“use-custom-venv”** field and replace **“false”** with **“true”**.
Find the **“custom-venv-path”** field and replace the **“/usr/bin/python3”** value with **“C:\Program Files (x86)\trendz\venv\Scripts\python.exe”**.

### Troubleshooting

If you want to make a clean installation, you need to remove all previous versions of Python:

* **1. Remove Python via “Programs and Features”**

Click on **Start**, then go to **Control Panel** → **Programs** → **Programs and Features**, find Python and Python Launcher, and remove them.

![image](/images/trendz/install/windows/windows-python-2.png)

You will see the uninstallation window like this:

![image](/images/trendz/install/windows/windows-python-3.png)

* **2. Uninstall Python from Chocolatey**

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

```shell
choco uninstall python
```

If you want to be sure no remnants are left, you can also check for:
**`C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\python*`**
and delete it manually if needed.

![image](/images/trendz/install/windows/windows-python-4.png)

* **3. Remove aliases**

Also, you need to switch off the Python aliases that can cause issues with working with Python in the command line.
For this purpose, you need to go to **Settings** → **Apps** → **Advanced app settings** → **App execution aliases** and find all items related to Python and switch them off.

![image](/images/trendz/install/windows/windows-python-5.png)

* **4. Remove remaining folders**

Make sure to delete the following folders along with all of their contents:

* C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python
* C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Roaming\Python

* **5. Last check**

Now, if you type “python” in the command line, you will get an error output like this one.

## Step 7. Run installation script

Launch windows shell (Command Prompt) as Administrator. Change directory to your Trendz installation directory.

Execute **install.bat** script to install Trendz as a Windows service.
This means it will be automatically started on system startup. 
Similar, **uninstall.bat** will remove Trendz from Windows services.
The output should be similar to this one:
  
  ```text
C:\Program Files (x86)\trendz>install.bat
Detecting Java version installed.
CurrentVersion 11
Java 11 found!
Installing Trendz Analytics...
...
Trendz Analytics installed successfully!
```

## Step 8. Start Trendz service

Now let's start the Trendz service!
Open the command prompt as an Administrator and execute the following command:

```shell
net start trendz
```
{: .copy-code}

Expected output:

```text
The Trendz Analytics service is starting.
The Trendz Analytics service was started successfully.
```

In order to restart the Trendz service you can execute following commands:

```shell
net stop trendz
net start trendz
```

Once started, you will be able to open Web UI using the following link:

```bash
http://localhost:8888/trendz
```

**Note**:  If Trendz installed on a remote server, you have to replace localhost with the public IP address of 
the server or with a domain name. Also, check that port 8888 opened for public access.

### Authentication

For first authentication you need to use **Tenant Administrator** credentials from your **ThingsBoard**

Trendz uses ThingsBoard as an authentication service. During first sign in ThingsBoard service should be also available 
to validate credentials.

## Post-installation steps
It is essential to follow these [instructions](/docs/trendz/post-installation-steps) to fully use all features, such as saving telemetry to ThingsBoard and adding Trendz views to dashboards.

## Troubleshooting

The log files are located in **logs** folder ("C:\Program Files (x86)\trendz\logs" in our case).

The **trendz.log** file should contain following line:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss,sss [main] INFO  o.t.t.TrendzApplication - Started TrendzApplication in x.xxx seconds (JVM running for x.xxx)
```

In case of any unclear errors, use general [troubleshooting guide](/docs/user-guide/troubleshooting/#getting-help) or [contact us](/docs/contact-us/).

## Windows firewall settings

In order to have external access to Trendz Web UI 
you need to create a new inbound rule with Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.
 
- Open "Windows Firewall" from "Control Panel":

- Select "Inbound Rules" on the left panel, then click "New Rule..." on the right "Actions" panel:

![image](/images/user-guide/install/windows/windows7-firewall-3.png)

- Now new "New Inbound Rule Wizard" window will open. On the first step "Rule Type" select "Port" option: 

![image](/images/user-guide/install/windows/windows7-firewall-4.png)

- On the "Protocol and Ports" step select "TCP" protocol and enter port **8888** in the "Specific local ports" field:

![image](/images/user-guide/install/windows/windows7-firewall-5.png)

- On the "Action" step leave "Allow the connection" option selected:

![image](/images/user-guide/install/windows/windows7-firewall-6.png)

- On the "Profile" step select Windows network profiles when to apply this rule:

![image](/images/user-guide/install/windows/windows7-firewall-7.png)

- Finally, give the name to this rule (for ex. "Trendz Service Networking") and click "Finish".
