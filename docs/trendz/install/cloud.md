## Trendz Analytics in ThingsBoard Cloud

Trendz Analytics in ThingsBoard Cloud is a fully managed, scalable, and fault-tolerant version of the [Trendz Analytics add-on](/products/trendz/).
It is already integrated into ThingsBoard Cloud and can be used to analyze your data.

* **Improved time to market.** Save time on maintaining the platform or configuring its features.
* **Reduced costs.** Infrastructure costs are shared between platform users.
* **High availability.** The Trendz Analytics uses a microservices architecture and is deployed across multiple availability zones.
* **Data durability.** The platform uses data replication and backup procedures to ensure you don't lose data.
