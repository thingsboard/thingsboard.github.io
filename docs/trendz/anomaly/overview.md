## Anomaly Detection Theory

**Anomaly detection** is the process of identifying unexpected behavior in telemetry data - patterns that differ 
significantly from what is considered normal. These anomalies can indicate system malfunctions, equipment degradation, 
security breaches, or operational inefficiencies.

In modern monitoring and analytics, anomaly detection is essential for:
- Predictive maintenance
- Early fault detection
- Operational efficiency

**Trendz** provides a powerful, out-of-the-box solution for anomaly detection, capable of automatically finding abnormal 
patterns in time-series data without requiring manual thresholding or expert labeling. For advanced users, Trendz also 
offers full control over the model configuration process - including input preparation, feature extraction, distance 
function tuning, and scoring logic - all within a convenient and intuitive interface.

You can find details how to use Trendz Analytics to create anomaly detection models here:

### Key Concepts in Trendz Anomaly Detection

In Trendz, anomaly detection is based on two core metrics:

- **Anomaly Score**  
  A numeric value representing how far a data segment deviates from expected (normal) behavior. Think of it as measuring the **intensity** of the anomaly.

- **Anomaly Score Index**  
  A composite metric that combines **anomaly score** with the **duration** of the anomaly. It helps prioritize anomalies that may have a **greater impact** over time.

**Real-World Example: Pump Vibration Analysis**

Let’s explore a real-world example showing pump vibrations right after startup:

![image](/images/trendz/anomaly/score_vs_index.png)

- **Anomaly A**
  - Characterized by a **sharp vibration spike** lasting ~5 seconds.
  - Results in a **high anomaly score** due to the sudden deviation.
  - Since it's short-lived, its **score index remains low**.

- **Anomaly B**
  - Shows a **longer-lasting deviation** without large spikes.
  - The **anomaly score is lower**, but the **score index is higher** due to extended duration.
  - This suggests a **greater long-term impact on pump health**.

While **Anomaly A** may appear more critical at first glance due to its spike, **Anomaly B** is likely *more important* 
to investigate due to its prolonged effect - this is exactly what the **Anomaly Score Index** helps reveal.
- Use **Anomaly Score** to detect sharp, short-term deviations.  
- Use **Anomaly Score Index** to surface sustained anomalies that may cause greater damage over time.

### Supervised vs Unsupervised Anomaly Detection

- **Supervised Anomaly Detection:**  
  Requires labeled datasets where normal and anomalous segments are identified in advance.  
  Models learn to classify data points based on these labels. Common algorithms include KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and LSTM.  
  *Limitations:* Needs extensive labeled data, struggles to detect new anomaly types not present in training.

- **Unsupervised Anomaly Detection:**  
  Does not require labeled data. Models learn normal behavior patterns by grouping similar data segments into clusters and detect anomalies as points that deviate significantly from these clusters.  
  Common algorithms include K-Means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Hierarchical Clustering.  
  *Advantages:* Automatically detects unknown anomaly types, suitable for real-world scenarios with limited labeled data.

**Trendz currently supports only unsupervised machine learning algorithms** for anomaly detection, leveraging clustering-based methods to detect anomalies in time-series data.

### How Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Works in Trendz

1. Collect and segment telemetry data.
2. Normalize and preprocess data.
3. Extract features describing each segment.
4. Cluster segments into groups representing normal behavior.
5. Compute anomaly scores based on distance from cluster centroids.
6. Apply model in real-time for continuous anomaly detection.

### Summary Tab

The **Summary** tab provides an overview of anomalies grouped by device.

You can:

- View anomaly statistics for **all devices** or a **specific device**.
- Select or deselect devices using the table below the graph.
- Choose the display mode using the **Review**, **Dynamic**, and **Calendar** buttons located in the upper-right corner of the screen.

**Available Modes**

- **Calendar Mode (All Devices):**
  - Displays the total anomaly index per day across all items.
  - Only months with anomalies are shown by default.
  - Enable the *Full Range* toggle to view the entire year.

- **Dynamic Mode (Selected Device Only):**
  - Visualizes monthly distribution of anomalies for the selected item.
  - Green bars represent the **total anomaly score index for the current device**.

  - Shows the **latest detected anomaly**.
  - You can zoom out to explore the full history of anomalies discovered on the current device.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="page-summary-tab" %}

### Review Tab

The **Review** tab allows you to inspect all anomalies detected during the **build**, **refresh**, or **reprocess** operations.

You can use this tab to:

- **Validate** the anomalies discovered by the anomaly model.
- **Fine-tune** the model by reviewing results and retraining if necessary.
- **Determine optimal thresholds** for alarm creation (read more about alarms [here](/docs/trendz/anomaly/alarms)).

You can **sort anomalies** by various fields to better analyze the results:
  - Total Duration
  - Score
  - Score Index
  - Item
  - End Timestamp

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="page-review-tab" %}

### Cluster Info Tab

In this tab, you can validate the clusters that were created during the model build process.

The **Cluster Info** tab provides insight into how many clusters were formed, what shape or pattern they represent, 
and how segments were distributed across them.

**Cluster Table**

At the bottom of the screen, a table is displayed with the following columns:

- **Cluster ID** – Unique identifier of the cluster.
- **Segments Count** – Number of anomaly segments that are closest to this cluster.
- **Segments Percent** – Percentage of anomaly segments that fall into this cluster.
- **Total Duration** – Combined duration of all anomaly segments that are closest to this cluster.
- **Min Score** – Minimum anomaly score among segments that are closest to this cluster.
- **Max Score** – Maximum anomaly score among segments that are closest to this cluster.

**Centroid Visualization**

At the top of the screen, you can view the **centroids** of all clusters. Each centroid represents the average pattern 
of all segments that belong to a cluster. These curves help users understand typical shapes or behaviors captured by each cluster.

You can also **click on any row in the cluster table** to open a detailed view. This view shows:

- The selected **centroid**, and
- **20+ random segments** that belong to this cluster.

This feature is useful for visually comparing segment variability within the cluster and validating clustering accuracy.

### Tasks Tab

In the Tasks tab, you can review tasks that are associated with the current anomaly model. Here you can validate tasks such as:
- Anomaly model build
- Anomaly model refresh
- Anomaly model reprocess

You can see their results, last executions, and more. Read more about Trendz tasks [here](/docs/trendz/tasks-service).

It is also possible to run the anomaly model reprocess task directly from this tab by clicking the **Run Reprocess Task** 
button located in the upper right corner of the screen (read more about anomaly reprocess [here](/docs/trendz/anomaly/refresh-reprocess#anomaly-reprocess)).
