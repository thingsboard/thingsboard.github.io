3. Write and send the question.
4. See the result.
5. If needed, write and send additional specifications to refine the response.

On this page, you can:

* **Type and send a new message**:

## Chat Topology Entities
To answer the query, AI Assistance should analyze the provided topology. It could be challenging to analyze the topology with hundreds of business entities and/or business entity fields, 
which could damage the accuracy of the AI Assistance. To increase the accuracy of the AI Assistance you can use the **Topology Entities window**.

You can access the Topology Entities tab by starting a new chat or by clicking on the selected business entities next to the Topology Entities label in the upper left corner of the screen.

To increase the accuracy of AI Assistance, you can specify which business entities or business entity fields it needs to know.

It is also possible to specify the description for a business entity or its fields. It could be useful when fields have unrepresentative names.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="trendz-assistance-topology" %}

All selected business entities and business entity fields affect only the chat in which you selected them. All added/changed descriptions affect all chats at the same time.

## Best Practices

- **Use the Topology Entities tab:** To increase the accuracy of AI Assistance, especially when dealing with complex topologies, specify which business entities
  or fields are relevant.
- **Add field descriptions:** If field names are unclear, adding descriptions helps the AI better understand and provide
  accurate responses.
- **Add specifications:** If you need to provide more context or correct something, adding additional specifications can
  improve the AI's response.
- **Use your own model:** For self-hosted applications or to avoid cloud token limits, consider configuring and using
  your own large language model.
- **Select the right model:** Choose a model that fits your performance needs and budget when self-hosting, balancing
  capability with cost-efficiency.
- **Give clear instructions:** Whether you're starting a new message or editing an old one, the more detailed your
  instructions, the better the AI Assistant can help.

## Limitations

### Token limitation (applicable only for cloud)

The number of messages you can send each month depends on your subscription type. When you`re using the Trendz AI model on the cloud, there are no additional charges.

To not be related to these limits, it’s possible to use your own model. To find out how to not be related to these limits, refer to the [Custom AI Model Configuration page](/docs/trendz/custom-ai-model-configuration/) for more details.

### Rate limits

The count of sent messages per minute should be less than:
* 6 for each user
* 20 for each customer
* 50 for each tenant

### Missing default system model (applicable only for self-hosted)

It’s impossible to use the default large language model for self-hosted clients. To find out how to enable the AI Assistant feature for self-hosted installation, please refer to the [Custom AI Model Configuration page](/docs/trendz/custom-ai-model-configuration/).

### Feature limitations

AI Assistance cannot:
* Create anomaly or prediction models, create calculation fields
* Create cards with the compared value
* Specify view/view field settings

These features will be added in future releases.

⚠️ This is a beta function, that could return incorrect results.
