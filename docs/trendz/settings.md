### Signing Key

For the application to function properly, it must authenticate with ThingsBoard on behalf of a user. This is required 
for background operations such as:

- Sending generated telemetry
- Fetching data for continuous prediction model fitting and forecasting

Storing user credentials in application memory is not secure. Instead, Trendz supports a secure mechanism using a 
**JWT signing key**, which should be stored in configuration files. It is expected that Trendz is installed on a 
secured server (as is ThingsBoard and similar systems).

You can alternatively store the signing key in the Trendz database automatically, but this method is **not recommended** due to security concerns.

An indicator in the settings shows whether the signing key is set and valid.

**How to Check Your Signing Key**

Scroll to the bottom of the **Settings** page to find the **Signing Key** panel. You will see one of two options:

- **The signing key is not valid (not set or expired)**  
  ![Signing Key Invalid](/images/trendz/signing-key-2.png)

- **The signing key is valid**  
  ![Signing Key Valid](/images/trendz/signing-key-3.png)

**Setting the Signing Key**

Follow these steps to configure the signing key:

1. **Log in to ThingsBoard as a System Administrator**  
   ![Login](/images/trendz/signing-key-4.png)

2. Go to **Security → General**  
   ![Security General Page](/images/trendz/signing-key-5.png)

3. Scroll to the **JWT Security Settings** section  
   ![JWT Security](/images/trendz/signing-key-6.png)

4. Copy the value from the **Signing key** field.

**Installation-specific Instructions**
- *Ubuntu Installation*

  1. SSH into the server running Trendz.

  2. Open the Trendz configuration file:

     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/trendz/conf/trendz.conf
     ```
     {: .copy-code}

  3. Add the signing key to the end of the file:

     ```bash
     export JWT_TOKEN_SIGNING_KEY=<signing-key>
     ```
     {: .copy-code}

  4. Save the file and restart the Trendz service.


- *Docker Compose Installation*
  1. Open your `docker-compose.yml` file.

  2. Add a new environment variable under the Trendz service:

     ```yaml
     environment:
       - JWT_TOKEN_SIGNING_KEY=<signing-key>
     ```
     {: .copy-code}
     ![Docker Signing Key](/images/trendz/signing-key-8.png)

  3. Save the file and restart the Trendz container.

## System
### Import / Export

To migrate data from one Trendz instance to another, use the built-in **Import/Export** mechanism.

You can export and import the following:

- Business Entities and their Fields
- View Configurations and View Collections
- Calculation Fields
- Prediction Models
- Anomaly Models and Anomalies
- AI Assistant Chats and Messages
- Prompts
- Tasks
 
**Exporting**

Just click the **Export** button—no additional steps are needed.  
The file will be downloaded automatically.

**Importing**

Click the **Import** button, choose the previously exported file, and configure the **Skip duplicates** option:

- Migration between **different tenants** is not supported.

### Cache Management

This section allows you to manage various cache layers used in Trendz, such as clearing local or telemetry cache.  
For more details, see the [Cache Settings documentation](/docs/trendz/cache-settings).

### External Data Source

Here you can configure and manage external SQL data sources and integrate them with Trendz views.  
Learn more in the [external datasource guide](/docs/trendz/mix-sql-datasource).

## White Labeling

You can customize the Trendz user interface (logo, colors, labels) to reflect your brand identity.  
Refer to the [White Labeling documentation](/docs/trendz/white-labeling) for full configuration options.
