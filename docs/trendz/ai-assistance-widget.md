The AI Assistant Widget is an interactive tool that allows users to engage in chat-based sessions for quick data retrieval and analysis. 
It can be added to a dashboard in ThingsBoard and provides an easy way to ask questions and receive instant responses.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="trendz-assistance-chat-example" %}

## Key Features

* **Chat-Based Interaction:** Users can type questions, edit them, and request new data. Responses appear instantly on the right side of the chat window.
* **History Tracking:** The widget stores previous questions and answers, allowing users to revisit past queries and view updated responses with the latest data.
* **Flexible Usage with or without Aliases:**
  * By default, the assistant provides answers based on all data accessible to the user.
  * Users can configure the widget to focus on specific entities (devices, assets, or groups) using aliases in ThingsBoard.
  * If an alias is linked, responses will be tailored to the selected entity.
  * If no alias is used, the assistant will still function and provide responses based on general available data.
* **Dynamic Entity Switching:**
  * Users can select a different entity, and the assistant will automatically adjust responses to reflect the new selection without requiring repeated queries.
* **Dashboard-Specific History:**
  * Chat history is tied to each widget instance and dashboard.
  * Different dashboards with separate widgets will maintain independent histories.
  * Users and customers only see their respective chat histories.

## Usage Recommendations
  
  * Place the widget in a convenient but non-intrusive location on the dashboard.
  * Use aliases to refine responses for specific entities or use the default mode for broader insights.
  * Take advantage of the saved history to streamline research and avoid repetitive queries.

Below, we will provide a detailed guide on how to use the assistant with aliases.
