[NodeMCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU) is an open-source IoT platform. It includes both firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC, and hardware which is based on the ESP-12 module.

The applications in these samples that are running on NodeMCU are written using Lua scripting language which is quite simple and easy to understand.
