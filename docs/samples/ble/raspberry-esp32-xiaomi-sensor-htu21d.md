## Introduction

{% include templates/what-is-thingsboard.md %}

This sample demo performs collection of temperature and humidity values produced by BLE broadcasting devices and further visualization on the real-time web dashboard. In this example we use [HTU21D]([https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13763]) connected to [ESP32](https://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) and  [Xiaomi Smart Temperature & Humidity Sensor]([https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Bluetooth-Temperature-Sensitive-Thermometer/dp/B07B9SJJZJ). The purpose of this application is to demonstrate ThingsBoard  [data collection API](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/telemetry/) , [visualization capabilities](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/visualization/), [gateway API](https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-gateway/what-is-iot-gateway/) and the capabilities of [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) protocol, which you can use with both custom and mass-produce devices.

Data is collected by a python script that is running on [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi). It pushes data to ThingsBoard server via MQTT protocol by using  [ThingsBoard MQTT client Python SDK](https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard-python-client-sdk) library. Data is visualized using built-in customizable dashboard. Demo that is running on Raspberry Pi is written in Python which is quite simple and easy to understand.

## Hardware setup

### ESP32 Wiring scheme

| ESP32 | HTU21D |
| ----- | ------ |
| 3V3   | VIN    |
| GND   | GND    |
| 18    | SDA    |
| 19    | SCL    |

The following picture summarizes the connection of ESP32 and HTU21D:

  ![Ble diagram](/images/samples/ble/esp32-htu21d-scheme.png)

### Raspberry Pi

In this setup we use Raspberry Pi 2 Model B V1.1 with [Raspbian GNU/Linux 9.8 (stretch)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) installed on it. Raspbian is a free operating system based on Debian optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware. This model does't support Bluetooth, so it needs a usb dongle. We use Grand-X BT40G.
Make sure your dongle is recognized by system. You can check it with the following command:
```
$> lsusb
...
Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle (HCI mode)
...

```

Whole setup:

## Preparing ESP32

### Application capabilities

In this project ESP is a GATT server, which creates BLE service with two characteristics, one is read-only, and the second is for both reading and writing.
Also it reads temperature and humidity data from connected HTU21D sensor and broadcast it as notifications to all nearby BLE devices.
You can find the source code [**here**](https://github.com/thingsboard/gatts_demo).
It is based on Espressif GATT demo server [**example**](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/bluetooth/gatt_server) and uses [**this**](https://github.com/lucadentella/esp32_htu21d) library to interact with HTU21D.

### Flashing ESP32 BT firmware

You need ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) to program your ESP32.
It is the official development framework for the ESP32 chip.
Install it with the following instructions:

```
mkdir ~/esp
cd ~/esp
git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
git checkout 3bf56cdd1
```

Set up IDF_PATH before running any other command:

```
export IDF_PATH=~/esp/esp-idf
```

The python packages required by ESP-IDF are located in IDF_PATH/requirements.txt. You can install them by running:

```
python -m pip install --user -r $IDF_PATH/requirements.txt
```

#### Note

Please check the version of the Python interpreter that you will be using with ESP-IDF. For this, run the command `python --version` and depending on the result, you might want to use python2, python2.7 or similar instead of just python, e.g.

See [**this**](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) guide for more info.

Now you can flash your ESP:

```
git clone https://github.com/thingsboard/gatts_demo
cd gatts_demo
make flash
```

Run `make monitor` if you want to see logs of ESP and check if everything is okay.
Example of output:

## Preparing MI Sensor
Install the battery in sensor.

## Preparing Raspberry Pi
Demo script scans for available BLE devices and connects to them. It can read a direct value of BLE characteristic from ESP and receive notifications from both ESP and Mi. If needed, a re-scan command can be issues from the dashboard to connect to new devices.

### Implementation details

If you are not interested in modifying or extending a list of supported devices, you can skip this sub-section.
The demo script consists of few modules: the main module and couple of extension modules.

The [**main**](https://github.com/thingsboard/tb-ble-adapter/blob/master/tb_ble_adapter/adapter.py) module is responsible for receiving commands from ThingsBoard and sending telemetry data. It also scans nearby devices and connects to them.

Extensions are [**modules**](https://github.com/thingsboard/tb-ble-adapter/tree/master/tb_ble_adapter/extensions) that responsible for extracting application-specific data from the BLE device. If you want to implement support for a new device, you can create additional extension class and inherit it from [**provided intarface**](https://github.com/thingsboard/tb-ble-adapter/blob/master/tb_ble_adapter/extensions/ExtensionInterface.py). Use [**this**](https://github.com/thingsboard/tb-ble-adapter/blob/master/tb_ble_adapter/extensions/MiTempHumidityExtension.py) as an example.

### Installing gateway scripts on Raspberry Pi
Login to your Raspberry PI using SSH and install demo. It requires at least **python3.4**. 
Also script requires superuser rights for Bluetooth management, so you need to install it system-wide.
```
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
sudo pip3 install tb-ble-adapter
```

## Device provisioning
Run python script **before** importing dashboard. For this you have to [**create**](https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-gateway/getting-started/) gateway device and specify it in command arguments:
```
sudo tb_ble_adapter -t $GATEWAY_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
Example of logs with device scanning, discovery of known devices and device connection:
```
Loading MiTempHumidityExtension extension...
Loading EspGattDemoExtension extension...

```
It creates devices:
![Created devices](/images/samples/ble/created_devices.png)


## Provision your dashboard
Download the dashboard file using this [**link**](/docs/samples/ble/resources/device_gw.json). Now you have to import it. To do this, configure aliases in such way (use gateway device from [**Device provisioning**](#device-provisioning) section):

  ![Configure aliases](/images/samples/ble/configure-aliases.png)

  ![Edit alias gw_devices](/images/samples/ble/edit_alias_gw_devices.png)

  ![Edit alias gw](/images/samples/ble/edit_alias_gw.png)

Also this dashboard needs a custom widget bundle. Download it with this [**link**](/docs/samples/ble/resources/custom_widget.json) and import using import/export [**instructions**](/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-library/).

## Data visualization
Finally, open ThingsBoard Web UI. You can access this dashboard by logging in as a tenant administrator.

In case of local installation:
*   login:  tenant@thingsboard.org
*   password: tenant

In case of live-demo server:
*   login: your live-demo username (email)
*   password: your live-demo password

See  **[live-demo](/docs/user-guide/live-demo/)**  page for more details how to get your account.

Go to **“Devices”** section, open created devices details and switch to **“Latest telemetry”** tab. If all is configured correctly you should be able to see latest telemetry values sent via BLE in the table.

  ![Latest telemetry](/images/samples/ble/latest-telemetry.png)

After, open **“Dashboards”** section and find previously imported dashboard **“Device GW”** and observe the following picture:

  ![Dashboard](/images/samples/ble/dashboard.png)

## Troubleshooting
In order to perform troubleshooting, you must check demo script output. It displays connection status with every device, as well as received and sent data.
