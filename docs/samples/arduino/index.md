[Arduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino) is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. 
Arduino boards are able to read inputs from sensor or buttons, process it and turn it into an output. The applications in this samples that are running on Arduino are developed using [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
