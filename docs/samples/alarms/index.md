In this short tutorial we will explain how to configure Email Plugin to distribute alarms to recepients. 

## Email Plugin configuration

If you are using [Live Demo](http://demo.thingsboard.io) or local [installation](/docs/user-guide/install/installation-options/) then you already have pre-configured email plugin that targets GMail.
You can open this plugin configuration page by navigating to **"Plugins -> Demo Email Plugin"** and clicking on red button in the top-right corner

Once you will open edit mode you can configure **username**, **password** and other parameters:

**Note** that we **DO NOT** recommend to specify username and password of your main Google account here. Especially on Live Demo instance. 
You can create one and use for test purposes.

The Email plugin may be configured to other mail servers.
