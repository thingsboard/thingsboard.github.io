ThingsBoars Cloud provides subscription plans based on the **pay-as-you-go** model. 
Main characteristics of the subscription plan are: [entity limits](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/tenant-profiles/#entity-limits), [api limits](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/tenant-profiles/#api-limits--usage), [white labeling](#white-labeling) and the level of support you get.   

### Entity Limits

Please see table below to compare the entity limits of the subscription plans.
