{% include templates/install/tb-30-update.md %}

{% capture tb_3_0_1_postgreSQL_windows %}
**Since ThingsBoard 3.0PE only PostgreSQL database is supported for entities data**

{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=tb_3_0_1_postgreSQL_windows %}

#### ThingsBoard PE package download

Download ThingsBoard PE installation package for Windows: [thingsboard-windows-setup-3.0.1pe.exe](https://dist.thingsboard.io/thingsboard-windows-setup-3.0.1pe.exe).

#### ThingsBoard PE service upgrade

* Stop ThingsBoard service if it is running.

```text
net stop thingsboard
```
{: .copy-code}

* Make a backup of previous ThingsBoard PE configuration located in \<ThingsBoard install dir\>\conf (for ex. C:\thingsboard\conf).
* Run installation package **thingsboard-windows-setup-3.0.1pe.exe**.
* Compare your old ThingsBoard configuration files (from the backup you made in the first step) with new ones.
* Please make sure that you set **database.ts.type** parameter value (in the file **\<ThingsBoard install dir\>\conf\thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" if you are using Cassandra database for timeseries data:

```
database:
  ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
  ts:
    type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
```       

* Finally, run **upgrade.bat** script to upgrade ThingsBoard to the new version.

**NOTE** Scripts listed above should be executed using Administrator Role.

**NOTE**: If you were using **Cassandra** database for entities data execute the following migration script:

```text
C:\thingsboard>upgrade.bat --fromVersion=2.5.0PE-cassandra
```
{: .copy-code}

Otherwise execute regular upgrade script:

```text
C:\thingsboard>upgrade.bat --fromVersion=2.5.0
```
{: .copy-code}
