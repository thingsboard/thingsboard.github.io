database:
  ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
  ts:
    type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
```       

* Finally, run **upgrade.bat** script to upgrade ThingsBoard to the new version.
