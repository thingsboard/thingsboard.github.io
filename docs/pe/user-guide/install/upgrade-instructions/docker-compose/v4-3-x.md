### Upgrading ThingsBoard PE to 4.3.0

{% capture difference %}
**NOTE:**
<br>
These upgrade steps are applicable for ThingsBoard version 4.2.1PE. In order to upgrade to 4.3PE you need to [**upgrade to 4.2.1PE first**](/docs/pe/user-guide/install/upgrade-instructions/docker-compose/v4-2-x/#upgrading-thingsboard-pe-to-421).

{% capture update_manifests_note %}
We strongly recommend that you also update your Docker Compose deployment manifests to [**the corresponding version from GitHub repository**](https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard-pe-docker-compose/tree/release-4.3) with every ThingsBoard upgrade. This ensures your ThingsBoard service runs with the latest best-practice parameters and configurations, while also guarantees that all required services are correctly deployed to support the newest features introduced in the release.
<br>
<br>
If you are running older releases of ThingsBoard - be aware that the manifests in `master` branch of the repository may contain configurations for features that are not available in your specific version. Always ensure that manifests are compatible with your target ThingsBoard version while merging deployment files.
