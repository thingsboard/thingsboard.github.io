#### Rule Chains management

Before assignment any rule chain to edge please get familiar with general concept of [**ThingsBoard Edge Rule Engine**](/docs/edge/features/edge-rule-engine/).

Please use 'Edge Rule Chains' icon to navigate to rule chains that are *'assigned'* to specific edge entity.
User is able to assign to edge any rule chains that he has access to.
