**Cloud Events** page shows events that ThingsBoard Edge pushes to the cloud.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="cloudEvents" %}

Check **Status** column to know if an event has been pushed to the cloud.
There are two status types:
* **Deployed** - event has been already pushed to the ThingsBoard CE/PE server.
* **Pending** - event has been created on the ThingsBoard Edge, stored to the local database and will be pushed to cloud as soon as connection is restored.
