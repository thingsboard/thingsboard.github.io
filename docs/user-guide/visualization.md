ThingsBoard allows you to configure customizable IoT dashboards.
Each IoT Dashboard can contain multiple dashboard widgets that visualize data from multiple IoT devices.
Once IoT Dashboard is created, you can assign it to one of the customers of your IoT project.
 
IoT Dashboards are light-weight, and you can have millions of dashboards. 
For example, you can automatically create a dashboard for each new customer based on data from registered customer IoT devices. 
Or you may modify the dashboard via script when a new device is assigned to a customer. All these actions may be done manually or automated via REST API.
