## Overview

UDP Integration allows to stream data from devices which use a UDP protocol to ThingsBoard and converts payloads of these devices into the ThingsBoard format.


**Please note** UDP Integration can be started only as [Remote Integration](/docs/user-guide/integrations/remote-integrations). It could be started on the same machine, where TB instance is running, or you can start in on another machine, that has access over the network to the TB instance.  

Please review the integration diagram to learn more.

## UDP Integration Configuration

### Prerequisites

In this tutorial, we will use:

 - ThingsBoard Professional Edition instance — [cloud.thingsboard.io](https://cloud.thingsboard.io);
 - UDP Integration, running externally and connected to the cloud ThingsBoard PE instance;
 - **echo** command which intended to display a line of text, and will redirect it's output to **netcat** (**nc**) utility;
 - **netcat** (**nc**) utility to establish UDP connections, receive data from there and transfer them;    

Let's assume that we have a sensor which is sending current temperature and humidity readings.
Our sensor device **SN-001** publishes it's temperature and humidity readings to UDP Integration on **11560** port to the machine where UDP Integration is running.

For demo purposes we assume that our device is smart enough to send data in 3 different payload types:
 - **Text** - in this case payload is **SN-001,default,temperature,25.7,humidity,69**
 - **JSON** - in this case payload is 
 
```json
[
  {
    "deviceName": "SN-001",
    "deviceType": "default",
    "temperature": 25.7,
    "humidity": 69
  }
]
```
 - **Binary** - in this case binary payload is **\x53\x4e\x2d\x30\x30\x31\x64\x65\x66\x61\x75\x6c\x74\x32\x35\x2e\x37** (in HEX string). 
  Here is the description of the bytes in this payload:
    - **0-5** bytes - **\x53\x4e\x2d\x30\x30\x31** - device name. If we convert it to text - **SN-001**;
    - **6-12** bytes - **\x64\x65\x66\x61\x75\x6c\x74** - device type. If we convert it to text - **default**;
    - **13-16** bytes - **\x32\x35\x2e\x37** - temperature telemetry. If we convert it to text - **25.7**;

  - **Hex** - in this case payload is hexadecimal string **534e2d30303164656661756c7432352e373639**. 
   Here is the description of the bytes in this payload:
     - **0-5** bytes - **534e2d303031** - device name. If we convert it to text - **SN-001**;
     - **6-12** byte - **64656661756c74** - device type. If we convert it to text - **default**;   
     - **13-16** byte - **32352e37** - temperature telemetry. If we convert it to text: - **25.7**;    
     - **17-18** byte - **3639** - humidity telemetry. If we convert it to text: - **69**;    
    
You can select payload type based on your device capabilities and business cases.
 
**Please note** that on the machine, where UDP Integration is running, port **11560** must be opened for incoming connections - **nc** utility must be able to connect to UDP socket.
In case you are running it locally, it should be fine without any additional changes. 

### Uplink Converter

Before setting up an **UDP integration**, you need to create an **Uplink Converter** that is a script for parsing and transforming the data received by UDP integration.

To create an **Uplink Converter** go to **Data Converters** section and Click **Add new data converter —> Create new converter**.
Name it **"UDP Uplink Converter"** and select type **Uplink**. Use debug mode for now.

**NOTE** Although the Debug mode is very useful for development and troubleshooting, leaving it enabled in production mode may tremendously increase the disk space, used by the database, because all the debugging data is stored there. It is highly recommended to turn the Debug mode off when done debugging. 

Choose device payload type to for decoder configuration

{% capture uplinkpayload %}
Text payload<br/>%,%text%,%templates/integration/udp/udp-uplink-converter-text.md%br%
JSON payload<br/>%,%json%,%templates/integration/udp/udp-uplink-converter-json.md%br%
Binary payload<br/>%,%binary%,%templates/integration/udp/udp-uplink-converter-binary.md%br%
Hex payload<br/>%,%hex%,%templates/integration/udp/udp-uplink-converter-hex.md{% endcapture %}

{% include content-toggle.html content-toggle-id="udpintegartionuplinkpayload" toggle-spec=uplinkpayload %}

#### Downlink Converter

**Currently UDP integration does not support Downlink functionality**

### UDP Integration Setup

Go to **Integrations** section and click **Add new integration** button. Name it **UDP Integration**, select type **UDP**, turn the Debug mode on and from drop-down menus add recently created Uplink converter.

As you mentioned **Execute remotely** is checked and can not be modified - UDP Integration can be only **remote** type.

Please note down **Integration key** and **Integration secret** - we will use these values later in the configuration on the remote UDP Integration itself.

![image](/images/user-guide/integrations/udp/udp-integration-setup.png)

By default UDP Integration will use **11560** port, but you can change this to any available port in your case. 

We leave other options by default, but there is brief description of them:
- **Enable broadcast - integration will accepts broadcast address packets** - a flag indicating that integration will accept UDP packets that were sent to broadcast address;
- **Size of the buffer for inbound socket** - the size in KBytes of the socket data receive buffer;

Choose device payload type for **Handler Configuration**

{% capture handlerconfiguration %}
Text payload<br/>%,%text%,%templates/integration/udp/udp-handler-configuration-text.md%br%
JSON payload<br/>%,%json%,%templates/integration/udp/udp-handler-configuration-json.md%br%
Binary payload<br/>%,%binary%,%templates/integration/udp/udp-handler-configuration-binary.md%br%
Hex payload<br/>%,%hex%,%templates/integration/udp/udp-handler-configuration-hex.md{% endcapture %}

{% include content-toggle.html content-toggle-id="udpintegrationhandlerconfiguration" toggle-spec=handlerconfiguration %}

Click **Add** to save the Integration.

#### Installing and running external UDP Integration

Please refer to the [Remote Integration guide](/docs/user-guide/integrations/remote-integrations) and install UDP Integration service locally or on separate machine.

Please use **Integration key** and **Integration secret** from the above section for your UDP Integration configuration.  

### Send Uplink message

Once ThingsBoard UDP Integration has been created, the UDP server starts, and then it waits for data from the devices.

Choose device payload type to send uplink message

{% capture senduplink %}
Text payload<br/>%,%text%,%templates/integration/udp/udp-send-uplink-text.md%br%
JSON payload<br/>%,%json%,%templates/integration/udp/udp-send-uplink-json.md%br%
Binary payload<br/>%,%binary%,%templates/integration/udp/udp-send-uplink-binary.md%br%
Hex payload<br/>%,%hex%,%templates/integration/udp/udp-send-uplink-hex.md{% endcapture %}

{% include content-toggle.html content-toggle-id="udpintegrationsenduplink" toggle-spec=senduplink %}

Once you go to **Device Groups -> All** you should find a **SN-001** device provisioned by the Integration.
Click on the device, go to **Latest Telemetry** tab to see "temperature" key and its value (25.7) there.

If your payload contains **humidity** telemetry, you should see "humidity" key and its value (69) there as well.
