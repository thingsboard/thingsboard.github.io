## Introduction
This tutorial will show how to set up and integrate diverse signals from District Heating Substation (DHS) facility into ThingsBoard IoT platform using Decode DL28 Communications processor. Signals from digital and analog I/O, Modbus RTU devices and M-Bus heat meters are combined in a single ThingsBoard dashboard. Due to simplicity only a few signals and devices are connected but in real world  installation up to several hundred devices and several thousand signals may be used.

## System diagram
System diagram shows some typical automation and metering elements in DHS: substation controllers or pump controllers connected to RS485 communication line, heat meters on M-Bus line and some I/O expansion to control valves and monitor level switches for example.

Decode [DL28](https://decode.rs/product/dl28/) device plays role of communication and signal concentrator and provides bridge function between all control, monitoring and measuring equipment installed in DHS and ThingsBoard servers on internet. Three signal are used in this example: two relay outputs and one of temperatures from heat meter.

Click on a Advanced tab and enter following parameters.



![image](/images/user-guide/integrations/decode/Picture7.png)



In Convert value function  enter following code for changing switch state. Data is published to topic **v1/devices/me/request+**.

```bash
if(value) return { "exio_relay_1": 1 };
else return { "exio_relay_1": 0 };
```



![image](/images/user-guide/integrations/decode/Picture8.png)



Click ADD button to add widget to dashboard. Using similar procedure, add another switch widget with Switch title **GT900 RL1**, Attribute/Timeseries value key **gt900_relay_1** and in Convert value function **{ "gt900_relay_1": 1 }** for switch in ON state and **{ "gt900_relay_1": 0 }:** for switch in OFF state.

Using similar procedure add two Led indicator widgets to display relay states, using LED titles **EXIO LED RL1** and **GT900 LED RL1**, and Attribute/Timeseries value keys **exio_relay_1** and **gt900_relay_1**.

Click on apply changes icon to save changes and to exit edit mode.

## Setup of DL28 device
### Step 1. Connection
Connect computer and the DL28 device to the same computer network with internet connection. Network addresses must be the same. Connect EXIO I/O expansion device to I2C port, modbus RTU slave to RS485 port S6 and heat meter to M-Bus master port S4 of DL28 using block diagram. Connect a power supply following safety procedures from user manual, and power up all connected devices.
### Step 2 . Sign in
Enter the IP address of DL28 device into web browser address bar and hit the ENTER. In popup window enter username and password. Default IP address, username and password are: **192.168.0.67**, **admin**, **admin** respectively.  After successful sign in the DL28 web page is loaded. Update current time on device if it is not valid. Change Default Gateway address in LAN settings if it is necessary.
### Step 3. Setup EXIO
In EXIO device menu click on Rescan button. EXIO device is detected and placed in device list. In this example EXIO type 3 is used (7xAI, 2xDO, 2xAO). Click Save button.
### Step 4. Setup Modbus RTU
In Modbus settings menu, check Modbus Master option and select value for poll interval and response timeout, for example 5 minutes and 10 seconds respectively. Click Save button.
In Modbus Poll list menu add two parameters. For relay on/off control use ForceSingleCoil and for readout of the relay state use ReadCoilStatus. Automatically assigned register addresses are 52000 and 52001.

### Step 5. Setup M-Bus
In Modbus Settings menu select M-Bus master mode, scan address range and polling interval. In this example address range is 1 to 3 and polling interval is 3 minutes. Click on a Save button.
In Modbus Slave List menu click on Rescan button to start detection of connected M-Bus device. When device is added to list, click Save button to save it, and click Reload button to load new device data.
Select a show/hide option to show detailed device data. Data values from M-Bus are stored in Modbus map using 4-byte float format. Find data fields of interest. In this example, Return Temperature is selected, stored in Input Register with offset 1222.

### Step 6. Setup MQTT
In MQTT Settings menu tick check boxes: Enable, Clean Session and JSON format. Enter Thingsboard broker data: Broker: **demo.thingsboard.io**, Port: **1883**, Reconnect Period: **10**, Keep Alive Interval: **60**, Client ID: Enter **Device ID** obtained from ThingsBoard demo account, Username: Enter **Access Token** obtained from ThingsBoard demo account, Password: Leave empty. Click on a Save button.
In MQTT Publish List menu add three parameters, two for publishing relay states,  and one for publishing return temperature from heat meter. Click on a Save button.

Enter MQTT Subscribe List menu. Subscribe to topic **v1/devices/me/rpc/request/+** for two parameters with keywords  **exio_relay_1** and **gt900_relay_1** and reference them to DL28 internal Modbus Holding register 508 and Input register 52000 respectively.
Click on a Save button to save changes and restart application by clicking on Restart button application in a Restart menu.

## Testing
Open the DL28 dashboard. Relays are controlled by clicking on switches EXIO RL1 and GT900 RL1. Indicators show real state of output relays and some delay may be noticed on slow networks. Widget CAL_RETURN_TEMP  displays return temperature from heat meter.

## Conclusion
It is shown that the ThingsBoard is ideal platform for remote monitoring and control of district heating substation facilities. The solution is very scalable in terms of increasing the number of devices, dashboards and widgets and may cover even large distribution networks for whole cities. It is also demonstrated that mixing of remote monitoring and control with meter reading is possible in a ThingsBoard system.
