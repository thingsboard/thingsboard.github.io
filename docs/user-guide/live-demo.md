Live Demo is a single-node server that is deployed to simplify the process of getting started with the ThingsBoard platform.

You can access the demo server using the following URL [**demo.thingsboard.io**](https://{{hostName}}/signup)

You will need to populate the sign-up form and as a result, you will receive tenant administrator account for your dedicated tenant.

Once you have logged in you will receive access to all dashboards and devices that are used in ThingsBoard [**samples**](/docs/samples/).
