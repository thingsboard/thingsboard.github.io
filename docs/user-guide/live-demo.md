Live Demo is a single-node server that is deployed to simplify the process of getting started with the Thingsboard platform.

You can access the demo server using following url [demo.thingsboard.io](http://demo.thingsboard.io/signup)

You will need to populate sign-up form and as a result you will receive tenant administrator account for your dedicated tenant.

Once you have logged in you will receive access to all dashboards and devices that are used in Thingsboard [samples](/docs/samples/).
