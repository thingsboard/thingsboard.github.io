The Live Demo is a pre-configured, single-node instance designed for rapid evaluation and testing. You can access the environment immediately at [**demo.thingsboard.io**](https://demo.thingsboard.io).
Once logged in, you'll have full access to our "Hello World" resources to jumpstart your project.

**Note:** New user registration is now directed to [ThingsBoard Cloud](https://thingsboard.io/installations/), which offers a permanent free-tier account with better reliability.
