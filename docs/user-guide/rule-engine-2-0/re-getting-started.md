## What is ThingsBoard Rule Engine?
Rule Engine is an easy to use framework for building event-based workflows. There are 3 main components:

- **Message** - any incoming event. It can be an incoming data from devices, device life-cycle event, REST API event, RPC request, etc.
- **Rule Node** - a function that is executed on an incoming message. There are many different Node types that can filter, transform or execute some action on incoming Message. 
- **Rule Chain** - nodes are connected with each other with relations, so the outbound message from rule node is sent to next connected rule nodes.


## Typical Use Cases 
ThingsBoard Rule Engine is a highly customizable framework for complex event processing. Here are some common use cases that one can configure via ThingsBoard Rule Chains:

- Data validation and modification for incoming telemetry or attributes before saving to the database.
- Copy telemetry or attributes from devices to related assets so you can aggregate telemetry. For example data from multiple devices can be aggregated
in related Asset.
- Create/Update/Clear alarms based on defined conditions.
- Trigger actions based on device life-cycle events. For example, create alerts if Device is Online/Offline.
- Load additional data required for processing. For example, load temperature threshold value for a device that is defined in Device's Customer or Tenant attribute.
- Trigger REST API calls to external systems.
- Send emails when complex event occurs and use attributes of other entities inside Email Template.
- Take into account User preferences during event processing.
- Make RPC calls based on defined condition.
- Integrate with external pipelines like Kafka, Spark, AWS services, etc.

## Hello-World Example
Let’s assume your device is using DHT22 sensor to collect and push temperature to the ThingsBoard. 
DHT22 sensor can measure temperature from -40°C to +80°C.

In this tutorial we will configure ThingsBoard Rule Engine to store all temperature within -40 to 80°C range and log all other readings to the system log.

#### Adding temperature validation node
In Thingsboard UI go to **Rule Chains** section and open **Root Rule Chain**.

![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/getting-started/initial-root-chain.png)

Drag and Drop **Script Filter** rule node to the chain. Node configuration window will be opened. We will use this script for data validation:

{% highlight javascript %}
return typeof msg.temperature === 'undefined' 
        || (msg.temperature >= -40 && msg.temperature <= 80);
{% endhighlight %}

![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/getting-started/script-config.png)

If temperature property not defined or temperature is valid - script will return **True**, otherwise it will return **False**.
If script returns **True** incoming message will be routed to the next nodes that are connected with **True** relation.
 
Now we want that all **telemetry requests** pass through this validation script. We need to remove the existing **Post Telemetry** 
relation between **Message Type Switch** node and **Save Telemetry** node:

![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/getting-started/remove-relation.png)
  
And connect **Message Type Switch** node with **Script Filter** node using **Post Telemetry** relation:

![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/getting-started/connect-script.png)

Next, we need to connect **Script Filter** node with **Save Telemetry** node using **True** relation. So all valid telemetry will be saved:

![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/getting-started/script-to-save.png)

Also, we will connect **Script Filter** node with **Log Other** node using **False** relation. So that all not valid telemetry will be logged in the system log:

Press Save button to apply changes.

#### Validate results
For validating results we will need to create Device and submit telemetry to the Thingsboard. So go to **Devices** section and create new Device:

![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/getting-started/create-device.png)

For posting device telemetry we will use [Rest API](/docs/reference/http-api/#telemetry-upload-api). To do this this we will need to
copy device access token from the device **Thermostat Home**. 

![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/getting-started/copy-access-token.png)

Lets post temperature = 99. We will see that telemetry **was not** added in Device **Latest Telemetry** section:

{% highlight bash %}
curl -v -X POST -d '{"temperature":99}' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/$ACCESS_TOKEN/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json"
{% endhighlight %}

***you need to replace $ACCESS_TOKEN with actual device token**

![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/getting-started/empty-telemetry.png)


Lets post temperature = 24. We will see that telemetry was saved successfully.

{% highlight bash %}
curl -v -X POST -d '{"temperature":24}' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/$ACCESS_TOKEN/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json"
{% endhighlight %}
