### Logs

ThingsBoard logs are stored in the following directory:

```

You can issue the following command in order to check if there are any errors on the backend side:
 
```bash
cat /var/log/thingsboard/thingsboard.log | grep ERROR
```

### Metrics

You may enable prometheus metrics by setting environment variable `METRICS_ENDPOINTS_EXPOSE` to value `prometheus` in the configuration file.

These metrics are exposed at the path: `https://<yourhostname>/actuator/prometheus` which can be scraped by prometheus (No authentication required).
