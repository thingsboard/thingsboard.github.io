This guide will help you to install and start ThingsBoard using Docker on Linux or MacOS.


## Prerequisites

{% include templates/install/docker-install.md %}

{% include templates/install/docker-install-note.md %}

## Running

Running this image requires a server with at least 4GB of RAM (8GB is recommended) and minimum load (few messages per second).

## Choose ThingsBoard queue service

{% include templates/install/install-queue.md %}

{% capture contenttogglespecqueue %}
In Memory <small>(built-in and default)</small>%,%inmemory%,%templates/install/docker-queue-in-memory.md%br%
Kafka <small>(recommended for on-prem, production installations)</small>%,%kafka%,%templates/install/docker-queue-kafka.md%br%
Confluent Cloud <small>(Event Streaming Platform based on Kafka)</small>%,%confluent-cloud%,%templates/install/docker-queue-confluent-cloud.md{% endcapture %}

{% include content-toggle.liquid content-toggle-id="ubuntuThingsboardQueue" toggle-spec=contenttogglespecqueue %} 

Where: 

- `8080:8080`            - connect local port 8080 to exposed internal HTTP port 8080
- `1883:1883`            - connect local port 1883 to exposed internal MQTT port 1883
- `8883:8883`            - connect local port 8883 to exposed internal MQTT over SSL port 8883
- `7070:7070`            - connect local port 7070 to exposed internal Edge RPC port 7070
- `5683-5688:5683-5688/udp`            - connect local UDP ports 5683-5688 to exposed internal COAP and LwM2M ports
- `tb-postgres-data` - name of the docker volume that stores the PostgreSQL's data
- `thingsboard-ce`             - friendly local name of the ThingsBoard container
- `restart: always`        - automatically start ThingsBoard in case of system reboot and restart in case of failure.
- `image: "thingsboard/tb-node:4.0.1.1"`          - ThingsBoard docker image and version.


## Initialize database schema & system assets

Before you start ThingsBoard, initialize the database schema and load built-in assets by running:   

```bash
docker compose run --rm -e INSTALL_TB=true -e LOAD_DEMO=true thingsboard-ce
```

Environment variables:

- `INSTALL_TB=true` - Installs the core database schema and system resources (widgets, images, rule chains, etc.).
- `LOAD_DEMO=true` - Loads sample tenant account, dashboards and devices for evaluation and testing.

## Start the platform & tail logs

Bring up all containers in detached mode, then follow the ThingsBoard logs:

```bash
docker compose up -d && docker compose logs -f thingsboard-ce
```

After executing this command you can open `http://{your-host-ip}:8080` in you browser (for ex. `http://localhost:8080`). You should see ThingsBoard login page.
Use the following default credentials:

- **System Administrator**: sysadmin@thingsboard.org / sysadmin
- **Tenant Administrator**: tenant@thingsboard.org / tenant
- **Customer User**: customer@thingsboard.org / customer
    
You can always change passwords for each account in account profile page.

You can safely detach from the log stream (e.g. Ctrl+C); containers will continue running.

## Inspect logs & control container lifecycle

If something goes wrong, you can stream the ThingsBoard container logs in real time:

```bash
docker compose logs -f thingsboard-ce
```

Bring down every container defined in your Compose file:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Launch all services in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Upgrading

When a new CE release is available, follow these steps to update your installation without losing data:

1. Change the version of the `thingsboard/tb-node` in the `docker-compose.yml` file to the new version (e.g. {{ site.release.ce_full_ver }}) 

2. Execute the following commands:
 
```bash
docker pull thingsboard/tb-node:{{ site.release.ce_full_ver }}
docker compose stop thingsboard-ce
docker compose run --rm -e UPGRADE_TB=true thingsboard-ce
docker compose up -d
```
