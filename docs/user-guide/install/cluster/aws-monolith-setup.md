This guide will help you to setup ThingsBoard in monolith mode using AWS EKS. 
See [monolithic](/docs/reference/monolithic/) architecture page for more details about how it works. 
The advantage of monolithic deployment via K8S comparing to Docker Compose is that in case of AWS instance outage, 
K8S will restart the service on another instance. We will use Amazon RDS for managed PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

{% include templates/install/aws/eks-prerequisites.md %}

## Step 1. Clone ThingsBoard CE K8S scripts repository

```bash
git clone -b release-{{ site.release.ver }} https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard-ce-k8s.git
cd thingsboard-ce-k8s/aws/monolith
```

## Step 2. Configure and create EKS cluster

{% assign eksNote = "**1** node of type **m5.xlarge**" %}
{% include templates/install/aws/eks-create-cluster.md %}

## Step 3. Create AWS load-balancer controller

{% include templates/install/aws/eks-lb-controller.md %}

## Step 4. Provision Databases

### Step 4.1 Amazon PostgreSQL DB Configuration

{% include templates/install/aws/rds-setup.md %}

### Step 4.2 Cassandra (optional)

{% include templates/install/aws/configure-cassandra.md %}

## Step 5. Installation

{% include templates/install/aws/eks-installation.md %}

## Step 6. Starting

Execute the following command to deploy resources:

```
 ./k8s-deploy-resources.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

After few minutes you may call `kubectl get pods`. If everything went fine, you should be able to 
see `tb-node-0` pod in the `READY` state.

## Step 7. Configure Load Balancers

### 7.1 Configure HTTP(S) Load Balancer

{% include templates/install/aws/http-lb.md %}

### 7.2. Configure MQTT Load Balancer (Optional)

{% include templates/install/aws/configure-mqtt.md %}

### 7.3. Configure UDP Load Balancer (Optional)

{% include templates/install/aws/configure-udp.md %}

### 7.4. Configure Edge Load Balancer (Optional)

{% include templates/install/k8s-configure-edge-load-balancer.md %}

## Step 8. Validate the setup

{% include templates/install/aws/eks-validate.md %}

{% include templates/install/aws/eks-upgrading.md %}

{% include templates/install/aws/eks-deletion.md %}
