Thingsboard is designed to run and utilize on majority of hardware, from local Raspberry PI to powerful servers in the cloud.
Ways to set up a Thingsboard cluster include:

 - [Docker (Linux or Mac OS)](/docs/user-guide/install/docker/) - install a single-node Thingsboard cluster on your Linux or Mac OS machine for development and testing.
 - [Docker (Windows)](/docs/user-guide/install/docker-windows/) - install a single-node Thingsboard cluster on your Windows machine for development and testing.
 - [Linux (Ubuntu & CentOS)](/docs/user-guide/install/linux/) - install Thingboard cluster on any pre-existing machines running Linux.
 - [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (Raspbian Jessie)](/docs/user-guide/install/rpi/) - install Cassandra and Thingboard server on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.
 - [AWC EC2 installation using AMIs](/docs/user-guide/install/aws/) - install a single-node Thingsboard cluster using public AWS AMI.
 
**NOTE** If this is your first experience with the platform, you may want to use our [Live Demo](http://demo.thingsboard.io/signup) to save some time on the installation. 
See live demo [documentation page](/docs/user-guide/live-demo) for more details.
