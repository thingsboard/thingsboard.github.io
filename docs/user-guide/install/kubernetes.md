{:toc}

This guide will help you to deploy Thingsboard into cluster on Google Cloud Platform using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

## Installation steps

- [Install Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/#Quick_Start)

- Make sure that you have [Google Cloud Platform account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) activated and you have sufficient funds to create clusters and provision instances.

- Download the following files from thingsboard repo:
    1. **[common.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/release-1.3.0/docker/k8s/common.yaml) - Kubernetes config file for common resources (StorageClass etc.).
    1. **[cassandra.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/release-1.3.0/docker/k8s/cassandra.yaml) - Kubernetes config file for Cassandra Service. By Default start 2 nodes.
    1. **[zookeeper.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/release-1.3.0/docker/k8s/zookeeper.yaml) - Kubernetes config file for ZK Service. By Default start 3 nodes.
    1. **[tb.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/release-1.3.0/docker/k8s/tb.yaml) - Kubernetes config file for Thingsboard Service. By Default starts 2 nodes.
    1. **[cassandra-setup.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/release-1.3.0/docker/k8s/cassandra-setup.yaml) - Kubernetes config file for Pod that creates Thingsboard keyspace and tables inside Cassandra storage.
      
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/release-1.3.0/docker/k8s/common.yaml > common.yaml
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/release-1.3.0/docker/k8s/cassandra.yaml > cassandra.yaml
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/release-1.3.0/docker/k8s/zookeeper.yaml > zookeeper.yaml
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/release-1.3.0/docker/k8s/tb.yaml > tb.yaml
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/release-1.3.0/docker/k8s/cassandra-setup.yaml > cassandra-setup.yaml
```

- Check server config to get available kubernetes cluster versions:

```bash
gcloud container get-server-config
```

- The output will be similar to: 

```bash
Fetching server config for us-east1-b
defaultClusterVersion: 1.6.4
defaultImageType: COS
validImageTypes:
- COS
- CONTAINER_VM
validMasterVersions:
- 1.7.1
- 1.6.7
- 1.6.4
validNodeVersions:
- 1.7.1
- 1.7.0
- 1.6.7
- 1.6.6
- 1.6.4
- 1.5.7
- 1.4.9

```

- Create cluster using gcloud cli (for demo purpose 6 standard nodes are going to be deployed for cluster pods).
Select from the list above *validMasterVersions* that is higher than 1.6.2 (**VALID_MASTER_VERSION**) and create cluster:

```bash
gcloud container clusters create YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --cluster-version=VALID_MASTER_VERSION --node-labels=machinetype=tb --num-nodes=2
```

- Create additional node pool for Cassandra and Zookeeper PODs:

```bash
gcloud container node-pools create cassandra-pool --cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --node-labels=machinetype=other --num-nodes=3 --disk-size=10
```

- Create default credentials file on your local machine:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

- Create common resources that are used by other resources:

```bash
kubectl create -f common.yaml
```

- Provision cassandra cluster:

```bash
kubectl create -f cassandra.yaml
```

- Monitor provisioning of Cassandra Pods by executing following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -w -l app=cassandra
```

- Please wait until all 2 Pods of Cassandra service become *Running*:

```bash
NAME             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cassandra-0      1/1       Running   0          5s
cassandra-1      1/1       Running   0          3s
```

- Once Cassandra Pods are running please provision Pod that will create Thingsboard schema and tables inside Cassandra storage:

```bash
kubectl create -f cassandra-setup.yaml
```

- Check logs of the cassandra setup node:

```bash
kubectl logs -f cassandra-setup
```

- And wait until message for success install: 

```bash
Adding group `thingsboard' (GID 102) ...
Done.

```

- Provision zookeeper Service:

```bash
kubectl create -f zookeeper.yaml
```

- Provision Thingsboard Service:

```bash
kubectl create -f tb.yaml
```

- Execute next command to see status of Thingsboard Pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods -w -l app=tb
```

- Thingsboard Pods should become into *Running* status:

```bash
NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
tb-0      1/1       Running   0          5s
tb-1      1/1       Running   0          3s
```

- Once Thingsboard Pods are in 'Running' status check logs of first Pod to make sure that everything is OK:

```bash
kubectl logs -f tb-0
```

- Thingsboard container is successfully started once similar line appears in the log:

```bash
2016-12-13 13:44:52,407 [main] INFO  o.t.s.ThingsboardServerApplication - Started ThingsboardServerApplication in 113.64 seconds (JVM running for 118.624)
```

- To obtain external IP of Thingsboard Service execute:

```bash
kubectl get services tb-service
```

- In the response something similar should appear:

```bash
NAME             CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                                        AGE
tb-service      10.3.251.137   35.185.81.65   8080:31099/TCP,1883:32314/TCP,5683:30062/TCP   1m
```

- Now you are be able to open Web UI using following link:
   
```bash
http://EXTERNAL-IP:8080/
```

- To delete the entire cluster execute following command:

```bash
gcloud container clusters delete YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME
```
