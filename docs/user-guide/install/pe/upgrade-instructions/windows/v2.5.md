### Windows

#### ThingsBoard PE package download

Download ThingsBoard PE installation package for Windows: [thingsboard-windows-setup-2.5pe.exe](https://dist.thingsboard.io/thingsboard-windows-setup-2.5pe.exe).

#### ThingsBoard PE service upgrade

* Stop ThingsBoard service if it is running.
 
```text
net stop thingsboard
```
{: .copy-code}

* Make a backup of previous ThingsBoard PE configuration located in \<ThingsBoard install dir\>\conf (for ex. C:\thingsboard\conf).
* Run installation package **thingsboard-windows-setup-2.5pe.exe**.
* Compare your old ThingsBoard configuration files (from the backup you made in the first step) with new ones.
* Please note that upgrading ThingsBoard PE from 2.4.3 to 2.5 version in case of using PostgreSQL database require to upgrade the PostgreSQL service to 11.x version.
* Please make sure that you set **database.entities.type** and **database.ts.type** parameters values (in the file **\<ThingsBoard install dir\>\conf\thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" in order to upgrade your cassandra database:

```
    database:
      ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
      entities:
        type: "${DATABASE_ENTITIES_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra OR sql
      ts:
        type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)

    # note: timescale works only with postgreSQL database for DATABASE_ENTITIES_TYPE.
```

**NOTE:** If you are using **PostgreSql(Sql)** for time-series data storage before executing the upgrade script, you need to access the psql terminal. Once you will be logged to the psql terminal, please follow the instructions below:

```bash
    # Connect to thingsboard database:
    \c thingsboard

    # Execute the next commands:

    # Update ts_kv table constraints:
    ALTER TABLE ts_kv DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ts_kv_unq_key;
    ALTER TABLE ts_kv DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ts_kv_pkey;
    ALTER TABLE ts_kv ADD CONSTRAINT ts_kv_pkey PRIMARY KEY (entity_type, entity_id, key, ts);

    # Update ts_kv_latest table constraints:
    ALTER TABLE ts_kv_latest DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ts_kv_latest_unq_key;
    ALTER TABLE ts_kv_latest DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ts_kv_latest_pkey;
    ALTER TABLE ts_kv_latest ADD CONSTRAINT ts_kv_latest_pkey PRIMARY KEY (entity_type, entity_id, key);

    # exit psql terminal 
    \q
```
{: .copy-code}

* Finally, run **upgrade.bat** script to upgrade ThingsBoard to the new version.

**NOTE** Scripts listed above should be executed using Administrator Role.

```text
C:\thingsboard>upgrade.bat --fromVersion=2.4.3
```
{: .copy-code}

#### Start the service

```text
net start thingsboard
```
{: .copy-code}
