### Windows

#### ThingsBoard PE package download

Download ThingsBoard PE installation package for Windows: [thingsboard-windows-setup-2.4.2.1pe.exe](https://dist.thingsboard.io/thingsboard-windows-setup-2.4.2.1pe.exe).

#### ThingsBoard PE service upgrade

* Stop ThingsBoard service if it is running.
 
```text
net stop thingsboard
```
{: .copy-code}

* Make a backup of previous ThingsBoard PE configuration located in \<ThingsBoard install dir\>\conf (for ex. C:\thingsboard\conf).
* Run installation package **thingsboard-windows-setup-2.4.2.1pe.exe**.
* Compare your old ThingsBoard configuration files (from the backup you made in the first step) with new ones.
* Please make sure that you set **database.entities.type** and **database.ts.type** parameters values (in the file **\<ThingsBoard install dir\>\conf\thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" in order to upgrade your cassandra database:
  
```
      database:
        entities:
          type: "${DATABASE_ENTITIES_TYPE:cassandra}" # cassandra OR sql
        ts:
          type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:cassandra}" # cassandra OR sql (for hybrid mode, only this value should be cassandra)
```

* Run **upgrade.bat** script to upgrade ThingsBoard to the new version.

**NOTE** Scripts listed above should be executed using Administrator Role.

```text
C:\thingsboard>upgrade.bat --fromVersion=2.4.1
```
{: .copy-code}

#### Start the service

```text
net start thingsboard
```
