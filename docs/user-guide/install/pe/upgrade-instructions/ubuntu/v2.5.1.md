Please refer to the guides below that will describe how to upgrade your PostgreSQL service on:

- [Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/ShvaykaD/1f0e6c1321a0a2b4b9f3b9ea9ab3e8d3)
- [CentOS](https://gist.github.com/ShvaykaD/313745d31a9af6db3d6a01ec9f16aac8)

**NOTE:** Package installer will ask you to merge your thingsboard configuration. It is preferred to use **merge option** to make sure that all your previous parameters will not be overwritten.
