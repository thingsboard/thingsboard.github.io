**NOTE:** Package installer will ask you to merge your thingsboard configuration. It is preferred to use **merge option** to make sure that all your previous parameters will not be overwritten.  
Please make sure that you set **database.ts.type** parameter value (in the file **/etc/thingsboard/conf/thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" if you are using Cassandra database for timeseries data:

```
database:
  ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
  ts:
    type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
```

```bash
sudo /usr/share/thingsboard/bin/install/upgrade.sh --fromVersion=3.2.1
```
{: .copy-code}
