This guide describes how to install ThingsBoard Professional Edition from AWS Marketplace. 
Using this guide you will install [BYOL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/pricing.html#ami-pricing-models) version of the product.
Basically, you get the license directly from ThingsBoard, Inc, but purchase corresponding server instances and infrastructure from AWS.

#### Step 3.7. Obtain your Public IP and EC2 Instance ID

In AWS EC2 console you need to wait while instance state will be changes to **running** and all Status checks will be finished.

![image](/images/user-guide/install/aws-marketplace-pe/tb-pe-mk-ec2-console.png)

On the image above example instance has this Public DNS name 

- **ec2-18-197-23-51.eu-central-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com**

Instance ID 

- **i-032b8bbf297987458**

Please save your Instance ID and Public DNS name to a safe place. We will use them later in this guide.  

### Step 4. Obtain your license secret

In order to activate your ThingsBoard instance you will need to get the license secret. 
ThingsBoard Licenses are managed by [ThingsBoard License Portal](https://license.thingsboard.io/signup).   

Please register on [ThingsBoard License Portal](https://license.thingsboard.io/signup) to get your license. 
See [How-to get pay-as-you-go subscription](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK-QDFGxWek){:target="_blank"} or [How-to get perpetual license](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPe0lHolWek){:target="_blank"} for more details.
 
Please save your license secret to a safe place. We will use them later in this guide.
 
### Step 5. Configure your license secret

Once you get the license secret, you should put it to the thingsboard configuration file. 

#### Step 5.1. Connect to your Thingsboard Instance over SSH

Please use the official guides: 

  * [Connecting to Your Linux Instance from Windows Using PuTTY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html) - for Windows users;
  * [Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html) - For Linux/Mac users.
  
Note: You will need to use instance Public DNS name (see [Step 3.7](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/aws/#step-37-obtain-your-public-ip-and-ec2-instance-id)) and the key file (see [Step 3.4](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/aws/#step-34-configure-key-pair-settings))

#### Step 5.2. Put License Secret to thingsboard configuration file

Open the file for editing using the following command:

```bash 
sudo nano /etc/thingsboard/conf/thingsboard.conf
``` 
{: .copy-code}

Locate the following configuration block:

```bash
# License secret obtained from ThingsBoard License Portal (https://license.thingsboard.io)
# UNCOMMENT NEXT LINE AND PUT YOUR LICENSE SECRET:
# export TB_LICENSE_SECRET=
```

and put your license secret. Please don't forget to uncomment the export statement. See example below: 

```bash
# License secret obtained from ThingsBoard License Portal (https://license.thingsboard.io)
# UNCOMMENT NEXT LINE AND PUT YOUR LICENSE SECRET:
export TB_LICENSE_SECRET=YOUR_LICENSE_SECRET_HERE
``` 

### Step 6. Launch ThingsBoard service  

Execute the following command to start ThingsBoard:

```bash
sudo service thingsboard start
```
{: .copy-code}

{% capture 90-sec-ui %}
Please allow up to 120 seconds for the Web UI to start. This is applicable only for slow machines with 1-2 CPUs or 1-2 GB RAM.{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=90-sec-ui %}

### Step 7. Connect to Thingsboard UI

Now you can open this link in your browser:

- http://PUBLIC_DNS_NAME/login

In this example:

- http://ec2-18-197-23-51.eu-central-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com/login

Use this login to connect as system Administrator 

- **sysadmin@thingsboard.org**

Default password for System Administrator is Instance ID (see [Step 3.7](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/aws/#step-37-obtain-your-public-ip-and-ec2-instance-id)). In this example: 

-  **i-032b8bbf297987458**

Now you can proceed to the next steps.

### Post-installation steps

**Configure HAProxy to enable HTTPS**

 * Step 1. Assign valid domain name system (DNS) record to your instance external IP address.
 * Step 2. Connect to your instance using SSH or PuTTY using instructions from the previous questions above.
 * Step 3. Execute the following commands:
 ```bash
 sudo certbot-certonly --domain smth.yourcompany.com --email support@yourcompany.com
 sudo haproxy-refresh
 ```
    where **smth.yourcompany.com** is your DNS name from the second step
    and **support@yourcompany.com** is your email to get notifications from [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).
