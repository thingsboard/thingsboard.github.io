This guide describes how to install ThingsBoard Professional Edition from AWS Marketplace. 
Using this guide you will install [BYOL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/pricing.html#ami-pricing-models) version of the product.
Basically, you get the license directly from ThingsBoard, Inc, but purchase corresponding server instances and infrastructure from AWS.

{:toc}

## Prerequisites

- Active [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/){:target="_blank"} account

## Step 1. Subscribe to ThingsBoard PE BYOL and Review Terms

Navigate to the [ThingsBoard Professional Edition BYOL](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07V8S6JLG) product page on [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) and click the **View purchase options** button to begin the subscription process.

Before completing your subscription, please carefully review all the information provided on the subscription page, including:

- **Product details** – Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model means that a valid ThingsBoard license must be purchased separately to activate and use the software.

- **Pricing details** – The software subscription cost is $0.00. However, AWS infrastructure usage charges will apply. Depending on your geographic region, applicable taxes and other charges may apply.

- **Terms and conditions** – By completing your subscription, you are confirming that you have read, understood, and agree to **End User License Agreement (EULA)** and the **AWS Customer Agreement**.

![image](/images/user-guide/install/aws-marketplace-pe/BYOL-subscribe.png)

After carefully reviewing this information, click the **Subscribe** button to proceed with your subscription.

## Step 2. Launch ThingsBoard PE instance 

After completing the subscription, a confirmation message will appear at the top of the page stating: *You have successfully purchased ThingsBoard Professional Edition BYOL*.

Click the **Launch your software** button to proceed. This action will redirect you to the software configuration and deployment options for ThingsBoard Professional Edition on AWS.

### Step 2.1. Setup configuration

On the configuration page, you will see a list of options, including **Service, Launch method, and Region**:

- **Service** - Choose a service based on how you want your product installed and configured in AWS. Each service offers different advantages and disadvantages and may have different configuration options. For this instruction we will use **Amazon EC2** that provides on-demand scalability and complete control over your computing resources, allowing you to quickly adjust capacity based on demand and maintain full access to the underlying operating system.

- **Launch method** - Choose how to package and deploy your application. Each method offers different deployment capabilities and management options. Your selected service type determines which delivery methods are available. In this instruction we will proceed with the **Launch from EC2 Console**.

- **Region** - Specify the AWS region where you want to deploy ThingsBoard Professional Edition.

![image](/images/user-guide/install/aws-marketplace-pe/service-setup.png)

When all options are set, click **Launch from EC2** to continue.

<!-- Remove this after 31 December 2025 -->
{% capture service-catalog-warning %}
On December 31, 2025, AWS Marketplace will stop supporting the ability to copy AMIs and CloudFormation templates to Service Catalog. You can continue to deploy AMIs and CloudFormation templates through the AWS Marketplace website or EC2 console. For more information, refer to [AMI-based products in AWS Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/buyer-server-products.html).
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=service-catalog-warning %}
<!-- Remove this after 31 December 2025 -->

### Step 2.2. Name and AMI Information 

On the **Launch instance** page, you will see the **Name and tags** section, where you can assign a name to your instance. The **ThingsBoard Professional Edition (BYOL) AMI** details are also available here, including its name, description, and publishing information. Verify that the correct AMI is selected, and then proceed to the next step to configure your instance.

![image](/images/user-guide/install/aws-marketplace-pe/setup-configuration.png)

### Step 2.3. Instance Type and Key Pair configuration

You can optionally change your EC2 Instance Type, VPC and Subnet. This step is usually for advanced AWS EC2 users.  

{% capture vm-min-req %}
ThingsBoard requires EC2 instance with at least **4GB of RAM**. Consider [adjusting the memory parameters](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/ubuntu/#step-6-optional-memory-update-for-slow-machines-4gb-of-ram) to ensure stability.
For optimal performance, we recommend an instance with at least **8GB of RAM** and **2 vCPUs**.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=vm-min-req %}

![image](/images/user-guide/install/aws-marketplace-pe/instance-type-and-key-pair-configuration.png)

You can select existing **Key Pair** or create new one for your instance. Make sure you have access to the key file before you proceed. We will use the key file later in this guide. 

### Step 2.4. Configure Security Group Settings

We recommend to use **Create security group** option to create predefined list of firewall rules that controls the traffic to and from your instance. If you choose **Select existing security group** during the instance setup, ensure that the chosen security group has inbound rules that allow traffic on the following ports required by ThingsBoard:

- **8080 (TCP)** – HTTP access to the ThingsBoard web interface.
- **1883 (TCP)** – MQTT protocol.
- **8883 (TCP)** – MQTT over SSL.
- **7070 (TCP)** – Edge RPC service.
- **9090 (TCP)** – Remote Integration service.
- **5683–5688 (UDP)** – CoAP and LwM2M protocols.

![image](/images/user-guide/install/aws-marketplace-pe/network-settings-configuration.png)

### Step 2.5. Storage Configuration

Specify the storage options for the instance. For this instruction we will use the default configuration with 20 GIB of gp2 storage.

![image](/images/user-guide/install/aws-marketplace-pe/storage-configuration.png)

### Step 2.6. Launch instance

Once all configurations are completed, open the **Summary** window to review your settings. After verifying that everything is correct, click the **Launch instance** button to start the **ThingsBoard PE** instance.

![image](/images/user-guide/install/aws-marketplace-pe/summary-launch.png)

### Step 2.7. Obtain your Public IP and EC2 Instance ID

When the instance state change to the **Running** and all **Status checks** will be finished, you can go to the **EC2 Instances** page and click on **Instance ID** to see **Instance Summary**.

![image](/images/user-guide/install/aws-marketplace-pe/instanceId.png)

Please save your **Instance ID** and **Public DNS** name to a safe place. We will use them later in this guide.

![image](/images/user-guide/install/aws-marketplace-pe/instance-summary.png)

On the image above example instance has this **Public DNS** name:

- **ec2-54-163-50-21.compute-1.amazonaws.com**

**Instance ID**:

- **i-0e614977a8e0f4f3b**

## Step 3. Obtain your license secret

In order to activate your ThingsBoard instance you will need to get the license secret. 
ThingsBoard Licenses are managed by [ThingsBoard License Portal](https://license.thingsboard.io/signup).   

Please register on [ThingsBoard License Portal](https://license.thingsboard.io/signup) to get your license. 
See [How-to get pay-as-you-go subscription](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK-QDFGxWek){:target="_blank"} or [How-to get perpetual license](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPe0lHolWek){:target="_blank"} for more details.
 
Please save your license secret to a safe place. We will use it later in this guide.
 
## Step 4. Configure your license secret

Once you get the license secret, you should put it to the thingsboard configuration file. 

### Step 4.1. Connect to your ThingsBoard Instance over SSH

Please use the official guides: 

  * [Connecting to Your Linux Instance from Windows Using PuTTY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect-linux-inst-from-windows.html) - for Windows users.
  * [Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect-linux-inst-ssh.html) - For Linux/Mac users.
  
Note: You will need to use instance **Public DNS** name (see [Step 2.7](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/aws-marketplace/#step-27-obtain-your-public-ip-and-ec2-instance-id)) and the key file (see [Step 2.3](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/aws-marketplace/#step-23-instance-type-and-key-pair-configuration))

### Step 4.2. Put your license secret to ThingsBoard configuration file

Open the file for editing using the following command:

```bash 
sudo nano /etc/thingsboard/conf/thingsboard.conf
``` 
{: .copy-code}

Locate the following configuration block:

```bash
# License secret obtained from ThingsBoard License Portal (https://license.thingsboard.io)
# UNCOMMENT NEXT LINE AND PUT YOUR LICENSE SECRET:
# export TB_LICENSE_SECRET=
```

and put your license secret. Please don't forget to uncomment the export statement. See example below: 

```bash
# License secret obtained from ThingsBoard License Portal (https://license.thingsboard.io)
# UNCOMMENT NEXT LINE AND PUT YOUR LICENSE SECRET:
export TB_LICENSE_SECRET=YOUR_LICENSE_SECRET_HERE
``` 

## Step 5. Launch ThingsBoard service  

Execute the following command to start ThingsBoard:

```bash
sudo service thingsboard start
```
{: .copy-code}

{% capture 120-sec-ui %}
Please allow up to 120 seconds for the Web UI to start. This is applicable only for slow machines with 1-2 CPUs or 1-2 GB RAM.{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=120-sec-ui %}

## Step 6. Connect to ThingsBoard UI

Now you can open this link in your browser:

- http://PUBLIC_DNS_NAME/login

In this example:

- http://ec2-54-163-50-21.compute-1.amazonaws.com/login

Use this login to connect as system Administrator:

- **sysadmin@thingsboard.org**

Default password for System Administrator is Instance ID (see [Step 2.7](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/aws-marketplace/#step-27-obtain-your-public-ip-and-ec2-instance-id)). In this example: 

-  **i-0e614977a8e0f4f3b**

Now you can proceed to the next steps.

## Post-installation steps

{% capture elastic-ip-note %}
By default, AWS Marketplace instances **do not assign a static public IP**. This means that the **public IP may change upon instance restart**.  
To ensure a persistent public IP, you must **assign an Elastic IP** to your EC2 instance. You can follow the steps in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-eips.html).
{% endcapture %}

{% include templates/info-banner.md content=elastic-ip-note %}

**Configure HAProxy to enable HTTPS**

 * Assign valid domain name system (DNS) record to your instance external IP address.
 * Connect to your instance using SSH or PuTTY (see [Step 4.1](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/aws-marketplace/#step-41-connect-to-your-thingsboard-instance-over-ssh)).
 * Execute the following commands:

 ```bash
 sudo certbot-certonly --domain smth.yourcompany.com --email support@yourcompany.com
 sudo haproxy-refresh
 ```
 {: .copy-code}

where **smth.yourcompany.com** is your DNS name from [Step 2.7](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/aws-marketplace/#step-27-obtain-your-public-ip-and-ec2-instance-id)
and **support@yourcompany.com** is your email to get notifications from [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).
