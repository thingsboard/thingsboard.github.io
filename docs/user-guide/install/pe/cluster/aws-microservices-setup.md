{% assign tbServicesFile = "tb-services.yml" %}

This guide will help you to setup ThingsBoard in microservices mode in AWS EKS. 

## Prerequisites

{% include templates/install/aws/eks-prerequisites.md %}

### Pull ThingsBoard PE images from docker hub

{% include templates/install/dockerhub/checkout.md %}

## Step 1. Clone ThingsBoard PE K8S scripts repository

```bash
git clone -b release-{{ site.release.ver }} https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard-pe-k8s.git
cd thingsboard-pe-k8s/aws/microservices
```
{: .copy-code}

## Step 2. Configure and create EKS cluster

{% assign eksNote = "**3** nodes of type **m5.xlarge**" %}
{% include templates/install/aws/eks-create-cluster.md %}

## Step 3. Create AWS load-balancer controller

{% include templates/install/aws/eks-lb-controller.md %}

## Step 4. Provision Databases

### Step 4.1 Amazon PostgreSQL DB Configuration

{% include templates/install/aws/rds-setup.md %}

### Step 4.2 Cassandra

{% include templates/install/aws/configure-cassandra.md %}

## Step 5. Amazon MSK Configuration

{% include templates/install/aws/msk-setup.md %}

## Step 6. Amazon ElactiCache (Redis) Configuration

{% include templates/install/aws/redis-setup.md %}

## Step 7. Configure links to the Kafka (Amazon MSK)/Redis/Postgres

{% include templates/install/aws/links.md %}

## Step 8. Obtain and configure license key

{% include templates/install/k8s-license-secret.md %}

## Step 9. CPU and Memory resources allocation

The scripts have preconfigured values of resources for each service. You can change them in `.yml` files under `resources` submenu.

**Note**: if you want to allocate more resources you'll need to increase the number of Amazon nodes or use larger machines.

Recommended CPU/memory resources allocation:
- TB Node: 1.5 CPU / 6Gi memory
- TB HTTP Transport: 0.5 CPU / 2Gi memory
- TB MQTT Transport: 0.5 CPU / 2Gi memory
- TB COAP Transport: 0.5 CPU / 2Gi memory
- TB Web UI: 0.3 CPU / 0.5Gi memory
- JS Executor: 0.1 CPU / 0.3Gi memory
- Zookeeper: 0.3 CPU / 1Gi memory

## Step 10. Installation

{% include templates/install/aws/eks-installation.md %}

## Step 11. Starting

Execute the following command to deploy ThingsBoard services:

```
 ./k8s-deploy-resources.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

After few minutes you may call `kubectl get pods`. If everything went fine, you should be able to see:

* 5x `tb-js-executor`
* 1x `tb-node` (We setup one node by default, you may scale it to many nodes if you have additional instances attached to your license key)
* 2x `tb-web-ui`
* 3x `zookeeper`.

Every pod should be in the `READY` state.

{% include templates/install/aws/start-transports.md %}

## Step 12. Configure Load Balancers

### 12.1 Configure HTTP(S) Load Balancer

{% include templates/install/aws/http-lb.md %}

### 12.2. Configure MQTT Load Balancer (Optional)

{% assign tbServicesFile = "tb-services.yml" %}
{% include templates/install/aws/configure-mqtt.md %}

### 12.3. Configure UDP Load Balancer (Optional)

{% include templates/install/aws/configure-udp.md %}

## Step 13. Validate the setup

{% include templates/install/aws/eks-validate.md %}

{% include templates/install/aws/eks-upgrading.md %}

{% include templates/install/aws/eks-deletion.md %}
