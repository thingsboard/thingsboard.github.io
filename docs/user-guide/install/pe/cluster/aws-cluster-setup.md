---

* TOC
{:toc}

This guide will help you to setup ThingsBoard in cluster mode in AWS. 

## Prerequisites

ThingsBoard Microservices run on the Kubernetes cluster.
You need to install a kubeone, terraform (v0.11+) and the kubectl (v1.16+).

[kubeOne](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/master/) - for create and manage kubernetes cluster.

[terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - for create and manage cloud infrastructure in AWS.

You can choose any other available [Kubernetes cluster deployment solutions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/).

## Step 1. Clone ThingsBoard PE Kubernetes scripts repository. Enter the terraform working directory

`
$ git clone https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard-pe-k8s.git
`

`
$ cd ./aws/kubeone
`

## Step 2. Generate ssh key

Kubeone needs ssh key for access to ec2 instance. By default, terraform uses ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. But you can generate your ssh key to any folder and add this path to terraform variables file.
To generate ssh key, please execute the following command:

`
$ ssh-keygen
` 

## Step 3. AWS credentials
Also you need access to AWS. It can be iam user or iam role. You need have a AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
To add environment variables, please execute the following command:

`
$ export AWS_PROFILE=default
`

`
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxx
`

`
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
`

## Step 4. Installation AWS cloud infrastructure

To initialize a working directory for terraform, please execute the following command:

`
$ terraform init
`

To create configure file for terraform, please execute the following command:

`
$ nano terraform.tfvars
`

And add this example config:
```
cluster_name = "k8s-cluster-example"
aws_region = "eu-west-1"
control_plane_type = "t3.medium"
```
Now we use this example config, but you can see all the variables in `variables.tf`.

To see what infrastructure will be created, please execute the following command:

`
$ terraform plan
`

To create this infrastructure, please execute the following command:

`
$ terraform apply
`

After executing this command we will have the infrastructure to create the k8s cluster.
For kubeone, we need to generate terraform output file with all resourse id. Please execute the following command:

`
$ terraform output -json > tf.state
`

Generate config file for kubeone. Please execute the following command:

`
$ kubeone config print --full > config.yml
`

You can change the settings for yourself. We will use default config.

To add your ssh key to ssh agent, please execute the following command:

`
$ ssh-add /path/to/your/id_rsa
`

To start deploy k8s cluster, please execute the following command:

`
$ kubeone install config.yml -t tf.state
`

After executing this command you will have a working k8s cluster with three master nodes and kubeconfig for your kubectl in this directory  $(pwd)/ .

To set KUBECONFIG variable for kubectl, please execute the following command:

`
$ export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/k8s-cluster-example-kubeconfig
`

And check your nodes in the cluster:

`
$ kubectl get nodes 
`

For manage workers node kubeone uses machinedeployments, please execute the following command:

`
$ kubectl get machinedeployments -n kube-system
`

To scale your workers node, please execute the following command:

`
$ kubectl --namespace kube-system scale machinedeployment/<MACHINE-DEPLOYMENT-NAME> --replicas=3
`

## Step 5. Review the architecture page

Starting ThingsBoard v2.2, it is possible to install ThingsBoard cluster using new microservices architecture and docker containers. 
See [**microservices**](/docs/reference/msa/) architecture page for more details.

## Step 6. Environment file.

Please go to back in root folder `cd ../../`.

In `.env` file set the value of `PLATFORM` field to `aws`.

## Step 7. Configure ThingsBoard database

Before performing initial installation you can configure the type of database to be used with ThingsBoard.
In order to set database type change the value of `DATABASE` variable in `.env` file to one of the following:

- `postgres` - use PostgreSQL database;
- `hybrid` - use PostgreSQL for entities database and Cassandra for timeseries database;

**NOTE**: According to the database type corresponding kubernetes resources will be deployed (see `basic/postgres.yml` or `high-availability/postgres-ha.yaml` for postgres with replication, `common/cassandra.yml` for details).

## Step 8. Choose deployment type

Before performing initial installation you can configure the type of ThingsBoard deployment.
In order to set deployment type change the value of `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE` variable in `.env` file to one of the following:

- `basic` - startup with a single instance of Zookeeper, Kafka and Redis;
- `high-availability` - startup with Zookeeper, Kafka, and Redis in cluster modes;

**NOTE**: According to the deployment type corresponding kubernetes resources will be deployed (see the content of the directories `basic` and `high-availability` for details).

If you selected `cassandra` as `DATABASE` you can also configure the number of Cassandra nodes (`StatefulSet.spec.replicas` property in `common/cassandra.yml` config file) and the `CASSANDRA_REPLICATION_FACTOR` in `.env` file. 
It is recommended to have 5 Cassandra nodes with `CASSANDRA_REPLICATION_FACTOR` equal to 3.

**NOTE**: If you want to configure `CASSANDRA_REPLICATION_FACTOR` please read Cassandra documentation first.  

Also, to run PostgreSQL in `high-availability` deployment mode you'll need to  [install](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) `helm`.

## Step 9. Upload Docker credentials

Make sure your have logged in to docker hub using command line. To upload Docker credentials, please execute next command:

`
./k8s-upload-docker-credentials.sh
`

Or you can use the following command:

`
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=[YOUR_USERNAME] --docker-password=[YOUR_PASSWORD] --docker-email=[YOUR_EMAIL]
`

## Step 10. Running

Execute the following command to run installation:

`
$ ./k8s-install-tb.sh --loadDemo
`

Where:

- `--loadDemo` - optional argument. Whether to load additional demo data.

Execute the following command to deploy third-party resources:

`
$ ./k8s-deploy-thirdparty.sh
`

Type **'yes'** when prompted, if you are running ThingsBoard in `high-availability` `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE` for the first time or don't have configured Redis cluster.

Configure your license key:

`
$ nano common/tb-node.yml
`

and put the license secret parameter 

```
# tb-node StatefulSet configuration

- name: TB_LICENSE_SECRET
  value: "PUT_YOUR_LICENSE_SECRET_HERE"
```

Execute the following command to deploy ThingsBoard resources:

`
$ ./k8s-deploy-resources.sh
`

After a while when all resources will be successfully started you can open ThingsBoard web interface in your browser using dns name of the load balancer. 

You can see DNS name of the loadbalancer using command:

`
$ kubectl get ingress -oyaml
`

Or you can see this name on the AWS ELB page.

You should see ThingsBoard login page.

Use the following default credentials:

- **System Administrator**: sysadmin@thingsboard.org / sysadmin

If you installed DataBase with demo data (using `--loadDemo` flag) you can also use the following credentials:

- **Tenant Administrator**: tenant@thingsboard.org / tenant
- **Customer User**: customer@thingsboard.org / customer

In case of any issues you can examine service logs for errors.
For example to see ThingsBoard node logs execute the following command:

1) Get the list of the running tb-node pods:

`
$ kubectl get pods -l app=tb-node
`

2) Fetch logs of the tb-node pod:

`
$ kubectl logs -f [tb-node-pod-name]
`

Where:

- `tb-node-pod-name` - tb-node pod name obtained from the list of the running tb-node pods.

Or use `kubectl get pods` to see the state of all the pods.
Or use `kubectl get services` to see the state of all the services.
Or use `kubectl get deployments` to see the state of all the deployments.
See [kubectl Cheat Sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) command reference for details.

Execute the following command to delete all ThingsBoard microservices:

`
$ ./k8s-delete-resources.sh
`

Execute the following command to delete all third-party microservices:

`
$ ./k8s-delete-thirdparty.sh
`

Execute the following command to delete all resources (including database):

`
$ ./k8s-delete-all.sh
`

To remove k8s cluster and aws resources, you can execute the following command:

```
$ kubeone reset config.yml -t tf.state
$ terraform destroy
```

## Upgrading

In case when database upgrade is needed, execute the following commands:

```
$ ./k8s-delete-resources.sh
$ ./k8s-upgrade-tb.sh --fromVersion=[FROM_VERSION]
$ ./k8s-deploy-resources.sh
```

Where:

- `FROM_VERSION` - from which version upgrade should be started. See [Upgrade Instructions](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/install/upgrade-instructions) for valid `fromVersion` values.
