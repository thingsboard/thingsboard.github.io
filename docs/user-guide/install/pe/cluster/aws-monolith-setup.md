{:toc}

This guide will help you to set up ThingsBoard in monolith mode in AWS EKS. 

## Prerequisites

{% include templates/install/aws-eks-prerequisites.md %}

## Step 1. Clone ThingsBoard PE K8S scripts repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard-pe-k8s.git
cd thingsboard-pe-k8s/aws/monolith
```
{: .copy-code}

## Step 2. Configure and create EKS cluster

In the `cluster.yml` file you can find suggested cluster configuration. 
Here are the fields you can change depending on your needs:
- `region` - should be the AWS region where you want your cluster to be located (the default value is `us-east-1`)
- `availabilityZones` - should specify the exact IDs of the region's availability zones 
(the default value is `[us-east-1a,us-east-1b,us-east-1c]`)
- `instanceType` - the type of the instance with TB node (the default value is `m5.xlarge`)

**Note**: if you don't make any changes to `instanceType` and `desiredCapacity` fields, the EKS will deploy **1** node of type **m5.xlarge**.

{% capture aws-eks-security %}
In case you want to secure access to the PostgreSQL, you'll need to configure the existing VPC or create a new one,
set it as the VPC for the ThingsBoard cluster, create security group for PostgreSQL,
set them for `node` node-group in the ThingsBoard cluster and configure the access from the ThingsBoard cluster nodes to PostgreSQL using another security group.

You can find more information about configuring VPC for `eksctl` [here](https://eksctl.io/usage/vpc-networking/).
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=aws-eks-security %}

Command to create AWS cluster:
```
eksctl create cluster -f cluster.yml
```
{: .copy-code}

## Step 3. Create AWS load-balancer controller

After the cluster is ready you'll need to create AWS load-balancer controller.
You can do it by following [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html) guide.

## Step 4. Amazon PostgreSQL DB Configuration

You'll need to set up PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS. 
One of the ways to do it is by following [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SettingUp.html) guide.

**Note**: Make sure your database is accessible from the cluster, one of the way to achieve this is to create 
the database in the same VPC and subnets as ThingsBoard cluster.

Here you should choose VPC with the name of your cluster:

![image](/images/install/cloud/aws-rds-connectivity-vpc.png)

Here you should choose security group corresponding to the one on the screen:

![image](/images/install/cloud/aws-rds-connectivity-security-group.png)

**Note**: in order to make PostgreSQL more secure you may create the separate security group, 
configure access only to the 5432 port and from the ThingsBoard nodes.
This can be achieved if you assigned security group to the `node` node-group in the `cluster.yml` file. 

Make sure that `thingsboard` database is created along with PostgreSQL instance (or create it afterwards).

![image](/images/install/cloud/aws-rds-default-database.png)

On AWS Console get the `Endpoint` of the RDS PostgreSQL and paste it to `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` in the `tb-node-db-configmap.yml` instead of `your_url`:

![image](/images/install/cloud/aws-postgres-endpoint.png)

Also, you'll need to set `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` and `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` with PostgreSQL `username` and `password` corresponding.

## Step 5. Upload Docker credentials

Make sure your have logged in to docker hub using command line. To upload Docker credentials, please execute next command:

```
./k8s-upload-docker-credentials.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

Or you can use the following command:

```
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=$YOUR_USERNAME --docker-password=$YOUR_PASSWORD --docker-email=$YOUR_EMAIL
```
{: .copy-code}

## Step 6. Installation

Execute the following command to run installation:
```
 ./k8s-install-tb.sh --loadDemo
```
{: .copy-code}

Where:

- `--loadDemo` - optional argument. Whether to load additional demo data.

After this command finish you should see the next line in the console:

```
Installation finished successfully!
```

Otherwise, please check if you set the PostgreSQL URL in the `tb-node-db-configmap.yml` correctly.

## Step 7. Configure secure HTTP connection

**Note**: if you don't need SSL connection over HTTP, you'll need to remove **alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports** and **alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn** 
lines in the `routes.yml` file and skip this step.

Use [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) to create or import SSL certificate.
After creation/import you'll need to copy certificate's ARN and paste it instead of **ARN_VALUE** in the `routes.yml` file:

![image](/images/install/cloud/aws-certificate-arn.png)
 
## Step 8. Configure secure MQTT connection

Follow [this guide](/docs/user-guide/mqtt-over-ssl/) to create a **.jks** file with the SSL certificate.
Afterwards, you need to set **MQTT_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD** and **MQTT_SSL_KEY_PASSWORD** environment variables in the `tb-node.yml` file
to the corresponding key-store and certificate key passwords.

You'll need to create a config-map with your JKS file, you can do it by calling command:

```
kubectl create configmap tb-mqtts-config \
             --from-file=server.jks=YOUR_JKS_FILENAME.jks -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl apply -f -
```
{: .copy-code}

where **YOUR_JKS_FILENAME** is the name of your **.jks** file.

**Note**: if you don't need SSL connection over MQTT, you'll need to set **MQTT_SSL_ENABLED** environment variable to **false**
and delete all notions of **tb-mqtts-config** in the `tb-node.yml` file.


## Step 9. Starting

Execute the following command to deploy resources:

```
 ./k8s-deploy-resources.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

After few minutes you may call `kubectl get pods`. If everything went fine, you should be able to 
see `tb-node-0` pod in the `READY` state. 

## Step 10. Using

Now you can open ThingsBoard web interface in your browser using DNS name of the load balancer.

You can see DNS name (the `ADDRESS` column) of the HTTP load-balancer using command:
```
kubectl get ingress
```
{: .copy-code}

You should see the similar picture:

![image](/images/install/cloud/aws-application-loadbalancers.png)

To connect to the cluster via MQTT or COAP you'll need to get corresponding service, you can do it with command:
```
kubectl get service
```
{: .copy-code}

You should see the similar picture:

![image](/images/install/cloud/aws-network-loadbalancers.png)


There are two load-balancers:
- tb-mqtt-loadbalancer-external - for MQTT protocol
- tb-coap-loadbalancer-external - for COAP protocol

Use `EXTERNAL-IP` field of the load-balancers to connect to the cluster.

Use the following default credentials:

- **System Administrator**: sysadmin@thingsboard.org / sysadmin

If you installed DataBase with demo data (using `--loadDemo` flag) you can also use the following credentials:

- **Tenant Administrator**: tenant@thingsboard.org / tenant
- **Customer User**: customer@thingsboard.org / customer

In case of any issues you can examine service logs for errors.
For example to see ThingsBoard node logs execute the following command:

```
kubectl logs -f tb-node-0
```
{: .copy-code}

Or use `kubectl get pods` to see the state of the pod.
Or use `kubectl get services` to see the state of all the services.
Or use `kubectl get deployments` to see the state of all the deployments.
See [kubectl Cheat Sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) command reference for details.

Execute the following command to delete **tb-node** and **load-balancers**:

```
./k8s-delete-resources.sh
```

Execute the following command to delete  **tb-node**, **load-balancers** and **configmaps**:

```
./k8s-delete-all.sh
```
{: .copy-code}

Execute the following command to delete EKS cluster (you should change the name of the cluster and zone):
```
eksctl delete cluster -r us-east-1 -n thingsboard-cluster -w
```
{: .copy-code}

## Upgrading

In case when database upgrade is needed, execute the following commands:

```
 ./k8s-delete-resources.sh
 ./k8s-upgrade-tb.sh --fromVersion=[FROM_VERSION]
 ./k8s-deploy-resources.sh
```

Where:

- `FROM_VERSION` - from which version upgrade should be started. See [Upgrade Instructions](/docs/user-guide/install/upgrade-instructions) for valid `fromVersion` values.
