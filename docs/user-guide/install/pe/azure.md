This guide describes how to install ThingsBoard Professional Edition from Azure Marketplace. 
Using this guide you will install [BYOL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/marketplace-faq-publisher-guide#pricing-and-payment) version of the product.
Basically, you get the license directly from ThingsBoard, Inc, but purchase corresponding server instances and infrastructure from Azure.

### Step 3. Review created resource

You will be navigated to the resource overview page. 
We should use this page to copy the external IP address of your instance. 
Please copy this IP address to a safe place. 
We will use it in our next steps. 

**As an example**, on the image below, the IP address is highlighted and set to "40.121.179.240"

### Step 4. Obtain your license secret

In order to activate your ThingsBoard instance you will need to get the license secret. 
ThingsBoard Licenses are managed by [ThingsBoard License Portal](https://license.thingsboard.io/signup).   

Please register on [ThingsBoard License Portal](https://license.thingsboard.io/signup) to get your license. 
See [How-to get pay-as-you-go subscription](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK-QDFGxWek){:target="_blank"} or [How-to get perpetual license](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPe0lHolWek){:target="_blank"} for more details.
 
Please save your license secret to a safe place. We will use them later in this guide.

### Step 5. Configure your license secret

Once you get the license secret, you should put it to the thingsboard configuration file. 

#### Step 5.1. Connect to your Thingsboard Instance over SSH

Please use the [official Azure guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/ssh-from-windows) on how to connect to Azure VM using SSH keys. 

Note: You will need to use instance Public IP (see [Step 3](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/azure/#step-3-review-created-resource)) and the key file (see [Step 2.1](http://localhost:4000/docs/user-guide/install/pe/azure/#step-21-basics))

#### Step 5.2. Put License Secret to thingsboard configuration file

Open the file for editing using the following command:

```bash 
sudo nano /etc/thingsboard/conf/thingsboard.conf
``` 
{: .copy-code}

Locate the following configuration block:

```bash
# License secret obtained from ThingsBoard License Portal (https://license.thingsboard.io)
# UNCOMMENT NEXT LINE AND PUT YOUR LICENSE SECRET:
# export TB_LICENSE_SECRET=
```

and put your license secret. Please don't forget to uncomment the export statement. See example below: 

```bash
# License secret obtained from ThingsBoard License Portal (https://license.thingsboard.io)
# UNCOMMENT NEXT LINE AND PUT YOUR LICENSE SECRET:
export TB_LICENSE_SECRET=YOUR_LICENSE_SECRET_HERE
``` 

### Step 6. Launch ThingsBoard service  

Execute the following command to start ThingsBoard:

```bash
sudo service thingsboard start
```
{: .copy-code}

{% capture 90-sec-ui %}
Please allow up to 120 seconds for the Web UI to start. This is applicable only for slow machines with 1-2 CPUs or 1-2 GB RAM.{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=90-sec-ui %}

### Step 7. Connect to Thingsboard UI

Now you can open this link in your browser:

- http://PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS/login

In this example:

- http://40.121.179.240/login

Use this login to connect as system Administrator 

- **sysadmin@thingsboard.org**

Default password for System Administrator is: 

-  **sysadmin**

Now you can proceed to the next steps.

### Post-installation steps

**Configure HAProxy to enable HTTPS**

 * Step 1. Assign valid domain name system (DNS) record to your instance external IP address.
 * Step 2. Connect to your instance using SSH or PuTTY using instructions from the previous questions above.
 * Step 3. Execute the following commands:
 ```bash
 sudo certbot-certonly --domain smth.yourcompany.com --email support@yourcompany.com
 sudo haproxy-refresh
 ```
    where **smth.yourcompany.com** is your DNS name from the second step
    and **support@yourcompany.com** is your email to get notifications from [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).
