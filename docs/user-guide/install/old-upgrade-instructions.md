**NOTE:** Package installer will ask you to merge your thingsboard configuration. It is preferred to use **merge option** to make sure that all your previous parameters will not be overwritten.  
Please make sure that you set **database.entities.type** and **database.ts.type** parameters values (in the file **/etc/thingsboard/conf/thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" in order to upgrade your cassandra database:
 
```
    database:
      entities:
        type: "${DATABASE_ENTITIES_TYPE:cassandra}" # cassandra OR sql
      ts:
        type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:cassandra}" # cassandra OR sql (for hybrid mode, only this value should be cassandra)
```

```bash
# Execute upgrade script
$ sudo /usr/share/thingsboard/bin/install/upgrade.sh --fromVersion=2.0.0 
```

#### Start the service

$ sudo service thingsboard start
