### Windows

**NOTE**: These upgrade steps are applicable for ThingsBoard version 3.2. In order to upgrade to 3.2.1 you need to [**upgrade to 3.2 first**](/docs/user-guide/install/upgrade-instructions/v3.2-windows/).

#### ThingsBoard package download

Download ThingsBoard installation archive for Windows: [thingsboard-windows-3.2.1.zip](https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/releases/download/v3.2.1/thingsboard-windows-3.2.1.zip).

#### ThingsBoard service upgrade

* Stop ThingsBoard service if it is running.

```text
net stop thingsboard
```
{: .copy-code}

* Make a backup of previous ThingsBoard configuration located in \<ThingsBoard install dir\>\conf (for ex. C:\thingsboard\conf).

* Remove ThingsBoard install dir.
* Unzip installation archive to ThingsBoard install dir.
* Compare your old ThingsBoard configuration files (from the backup you made in the first step) with new ones.
* Please make sure that you set **database.ts.type** parameter value (in the file **\<ThingsBoard install dir\>\conf\thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" if you are using Cassandra database for timeseries data:

```
  database:
    ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
    ts:
      type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
```

* Finally, run **upgrade.bat** script to upgrade ThingsBoard to the new version.

**NOTE** Scripts listed above should be executed using Administrator Role.

Execute regular upgrade script:

```text
C:\thingsboard>upgrade.bat --fromVersion=3.2.0
```
{: .copy-code}

#### Start the service
