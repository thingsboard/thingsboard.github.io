This ensures your ThingsBoard service runs with the latest best-practice parameters and configurations, while also guarantees that all required services are correctly deployed to support the newest features introduced in the release.

If you are running older releases of ThingsBoard - be aware that the manifests in `master` branch of the repository may contain configurations for features that are not available in your specific version.
