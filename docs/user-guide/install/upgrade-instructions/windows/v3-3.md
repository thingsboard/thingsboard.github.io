### Windows

**NOTE**: These upgrade steps are applicable for ThingsBoard version 3.2.2. In order to upgrade to 3.3 you need to [**upgrade to 3.2.2 first**](/docs/user-guide/install/upgrade-instructions/windows/v3-2-2/).

#### ThingsBoard package download

Download ThingsBoard installation archive for Windows: [thingsboard-windows-3.3.zip](https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/releases/download/v3.3/thingsboard-windows-3.3.zip).

#### ThingsBoard service upgrade

* Stop ThingsBoard service if it is running.

```text
net stop thingsboard
```
{: .copy-code}

* Make a backup of previous ThingsBoard configuration located in \<ThingsBoard install dir\>\conf (for ex. C:\thingsboard\conf).

* Remove ThingsBoard install dir.
* Unzip installation archive to ThingsBoard install dir.
* Compare your old ThingsBoard configuration files (from the backup you made in the first step) with new ones.
* Please make sure that you set **database.ts.type** parameter value (in the file **\<ThingsBoard install dir\>\conf\thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" if you are using Cassandra database for timeseries data:

```
  database:
    ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
    ts:
      type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
```

* If you were using MQTT over SSL instead of default MQTT, please make sure you have a proper configuration (**thingsboard.yml**) of ports/addresses:

```
transport:

. . .

  # Local MQTT transport parameters
  mqtt:
    # Enable/disable mqtt transport protocol.
    enabled: "${MQTT_ENABLED:true}"
    bind_address: "${MQTT_BIND_ADDRESS:0.0.0.0}"
    bind_port: "${MQTT_BIND_PORT:1883}"

. . .

    ssl:
      # Enable/disable SSL support
      enabled: "${MQTT_SSL_ENABLED:true}"
      # MQTT SSL bind address
      bind_address: "${MQTT_SSL_BIND_ADDRESS:0.0.0.0}"
      # MQTT SSL bind port
      bind_port: "${MQTT_SSL_BIND_PORT:8883}"
```

* Finally, run **upgrade.bat** script to upgrade ThingsBoard to the new version.

**NOTE** Scripts listed above should be executed using Administrator Role.

Execute regular upgrade script:

```text
C:\thingsboard>upgrade.bat --fromVersion=3.2.2
```
{: .copy-code}

#### Start the service

{% include templates/redis-post-upgrade-notice.md %}

{% include templates/redis-post-upgrade-notice.md %}

```text
net start thingsboard
```
{: .copy-code}
