### Ubuntu

**NOTE**: These upgrade steps are applicable for ThingsBoard version 3.1. In order to upgrade to 3.1.1 you need to [**upgrade to 3.1 first**](/docs/user-guide/install/upgrade-instructions/v3.1-ubuntu/).

#### ThingsBoard package download

{% include code.html file="resources/3.1.1/thingsboard-ubuntu-download.sh" language="shell" %}  

#### ThingsBoard service upgrade

* Stop ThingsBoard service if it is running.

```bash
$ sudo service thingsboard stop
```

{% include code.html file="resources/3.1.1/thingsboard-ubuntu-installation.sh" language="shell" %}

**NOTE:** Package installer will ask you to merge your thingsboard configuration. It is preferred to use **merge option** to make sure that all your previous parameters will not be overwritten.  
Please make sure that you set **database.ts.type** parameter value (in the file **/etc/thingsboard/conf/thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" if you are using Cassandra database for timeseries data:

```
database:
  ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
  ts:
    type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
```

Execute regular upgrade script:

```bash
sudo /usr/share/thingsboard/bin/install/upgrade.sh --fromVersion=3.1.0
```
{: .copy-code}

#### Start the service

{% include templates/redis-post-upgrade-notice.md %}

{% include templates/redis-post-upgrade-notice.md %}

```bash
sudo service thingsboard start
```
{: .copy-code}
