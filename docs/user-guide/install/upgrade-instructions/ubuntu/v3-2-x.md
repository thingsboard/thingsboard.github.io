### Upgrading ThingsBoard CE to 3.2.2

**NOTE**: These upgrade steps are applicable for ThingsBoard version 3.2.1. In order to upgrade to 3.2.2 you need to [**upgrade to 3.2.1 first**](#upgrading-thingsboard-ce-to-321).

<br>

{% capture tb_3_2_2_java_11_linux %}
**NOTE: Since ThingsBoard version 3.2.2 Java 11 is used**
- Please install Java 11 before proceeding upgrade procedure using the following guide:
  - [Java 11 Installation on Ubuntu](/docs/user-guide/install/ubuntu/#step-1-install-java-11-openjdk)
  - [Java 11 Installation on CentOS/RHEL](/docs/user-guide/install/rhel/#step-1-install-java-11-openjdk)

{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/warn-banner.md content=tb_3_2_2_java_11_linux %}


{% capture cassandra-in-beta %}
Please note that Cassandra 4.x is still in beta. ThingsBoard is compatible with Cassandra 3.x as well.
However, since ThingsBoard 3.2.2+ requires Java 11 and Cassandra 3.x is [not compatible](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/new/java11.html) with Java 8, you **can't launch ThingsBoard 3.2.2+ and Cassandra 3.x on the same machine without separate docker containers for both.**.
{% if docsPrefix == "pe/" %}
Please consider using [docker compose](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/cluster/docker-compose-setup/) or other [cluster setup](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/cluster-setup/)
to avoid issues with beta version of Cassandra.
{% else %}
Please consider using [docker compose](/docs/user-guide/install/cluster/docker-compose-setup/) or other [cluster setup](/docs/user-guide/install/cluster-setup/)
to avoid issues with beta version of Cassandra.
{% endif %}
{% endcapture %}

#### ThingsBoard package download

{% include resources.liquid version="3.2.2" kind="ubuntu-download" %}  

#### ThingsBoard service upgrade

* Stop ThingsBoard service if it is running.

```bash
$ sudo service thingsboard stop
```

{% include resources.liquid version="3.2.2" kind="ubuntu-installation" %}

**NOTE:** Package installer will ask you to merge your thingsboard configuration. It is preferred to use **merge option** to make sure that all your previous parameters will not be overwritten.  
Please make sure that you set **database.ts.type** parameter value (in the file **/etc/thingsboard/conf/thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" if you are using Cassandra database for timeseries data:

```
  database:
    ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
    ts:
      type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
```

Execute regular upgrade script:

```bash
sudo /usr/share/thingsboard/bin/install/upgrade.sh --fromVersion=3.2.1
```
{: .copy-code}

#### Start the service
