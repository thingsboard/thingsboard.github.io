### Upgrading ThingsBoard CE to 3.1.1

**NOTE**: These upgrade steps are applicable for ThingsBoard version 3.1. In order to upgrade to 3.1.1 you need to [**upgrade to 3.1 first**](#upgrading-thingsboard-ce-to-31).

#### ThingsBoard package download

{% include resources.liquid version="3.1.1" kind="ubuntu-download" %}  

#### ThingsBoard service upgrade

* Stop ThingsBoard service if it is running.

```bash
$ sudo service thingsboard stop
```

{% include resources.liquid version="3.1.1" kind="ubuntu-installation" %}

**NOTE:** Package installer will ask you to merge your thingsboard configuration. It is preferred to use **merge option** to make sure that all your previous parameters will not be overwritten.  
Please make sure that you set **database.ts.type** parameter value (in the file **/etc/thingsboard/conf/thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" if you are using Cassandra database for timeseries data:

```
database:
  ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
  ts:
    type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
```

Execute regular upgrade script:

```bash
sudo /usr/share/thingsboard/bin/install/upgrade.sh --fromVersion=3.1.0
```
{: .copy-code}

#### Start the service

{% include templates/redis-post-upgrade-notice.md %}

{% include templates/redis-post-upgrade-notice.md %}

```bash
sudo service thingsboard start
```
{: .copy-code}

### Upgrading ThingsBoard CE to 3.1

**NOTE**: These upgrade steps are applicable for ThingsBoard version 3.0.1. In order to upgrade to 3.1 you need to [**upgrade to 3.0.1 first**](/docs/user-guide/install/upgrade-instructions/ubuntu/v3-0-x/#upgrading-thingsboard-ce-to-301).

#### ThingsBoard package download

{% include resources.liquid version="3.1" kind="ubuntu-download" %}  

#### ThingsBoard service upgrade

* Stop ThingsBoard service if it is running.

```bash
$ sudo service thingsboard stop
```

{% include resources.liquid version="3.1" kind="ubuntu-installation" %}

**NOTE:** Package installer will ask you to merge your thingsboard configuration. It is preferred to use **merge option** to make sure that all your previous parameters will not be overwritten.  
Please make sure that you set **database.ts.type** parameter value (in the file **/etc/thingsboard/conf/thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" if you are using Cassandra database for timeseries data:

```
  database:
    ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
    ts:
      type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
```

**NOTE**: Cassandra database does not support [advanced filters](/docs/user-guide/advanced-filters/). If you were using **Cassandra** database for timeseries data please make sure that **database.ts_latest.type** parameter value (in the file **/etc/thingsboard/conf/thingsboard.yml**) is "sql":

```
  database:
  ...
    ts_latest:
      type: "${DATABASE_TS_LATEST_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
```

and execute the following migration script:

```bash
# Execute script to migrate latest timeseries data from Cassandra to PostgreSQL
sudo /usr/share/thingsboard/bin/install/upgrade.sh --fromVersion=cassandra-latest-to-postgres
```
{: .copy-code}

Execute regular upgrade script:

```bash
sudo /usr/share/thingsboard/bin/install/upgrade.sh --fromVersion=3.0.1
```
{: .copy-code}

#### Start the service

{% include templates/redis-post-upgrade-notice.md %}

{% include templates/redis-post-upgrade-notice.md %}

```bash
sudo service thingsboard start
```
{: .copy-code}
