## Upgrading to 3.3.1 {#upgrading-to-331}

### Ubuntu/CentOS {#ubuntucentos-331}

**NOTE**: These upgrade steps are applicable for ThingsBoard version 3.3.0. In order to upgrade to 3.3.1 you need to [**upgrade to 3.3.0 first**](/docs/user-guide/install/upgrade-instructions/#ubuntucentos-33).

#### ThingsBoard package download

{% capture tabspec %}thingsboard-download-3-3-1
thingsboard-download-3-3-1-ubuntu,Ubuntu,shell,resources/3.3.1/thingsboard-ubuntu-download.sh,/docs/user-guide/install/resources/3.3.1/thingsboard-ubuntu-download.sh
thingsboard-download-3-3-1-centos,CentOS,shell,resources/3.3.1/thingsboard-centos-download.sh,/docs/user-guide/install/resources/3.3.1/thingsboard-centos-download.sh{% endcapture %}
{% include tabs.html %}

#### ThingsBoard service upgrade

{% capture tabspec %}thingsboard-installation-3-3-1
thingsboard-installation-3-3-1-ubuntu,Ubuntu,shell,resources/3.3.1/thingsboard-ubuntu-installation.sh,/docs/user-guide/install/resources/3.3.1/thingsboard-ubuntu-installation.sh
thingsboard-installation-3-3-1-centos,CentOS,shell,resources/3.3.1/thingsboard-centos-installation.sh,/docs/user-guide/install/resources/3.3.1/thingsboard-centos-installation.sh{% endcapture %}
{% include tabs.html %}

**NOTE:** Package installer may ask you to merge your thingsboard configuration. It is preferred to use **merge option** to make sure that all your previous parameters will not be overwritten.
Please make sure that you set **database.ts.type** parameter value (in the file **/etc/thingsboard/conf/thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" if you are using Cassandra database for timeseries data:

```
database:
  ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
  ts:
    type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
```

Execute regular upgrade script:

```bash
# Execute regular upgrade script
$ sudo /usr/share/thingsboard/bin/install/upgrade.sh --fromVersion=3.3.0
```

#### Start the service

```bash
$ sudo service thingsboard start
```

### Windows {#windows-331}

**NOTE**: These upgrade steps are applicable for ThingsBoard version 3.3.0. In order to upgrade to 3.3.1 you need to [**upgrade to 3.3.0 first**](/docs/user-guide/install/upgrade-instructions/#windows-33).

#### ThingsBoard package download

Download ThingsBoard installation archive for Windows: [thingsboard-windows-3.3.1.zip](https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/releases/download/v3.3.1/thingsboard-windows-3.3.1.zip).

#### ThingsBoard service upgrade

* Stop ThingsBoard service if it is running.

```text
net stop thingsboard
```

* Make a backup of previous ThingsBoard configuration located in \<ThingsBoard install dir\>\conf (for ex. C:\thingsboard\conf).

* Remove ThingsBoard install dir.
* Unzip installation archive to ThingsBoard install dir.
* Compare your old ThingsBoard configuration files (from the backup you made in the first step) with new ones.
* Please make sure that you set **database.ts.type** parameter value (in the file **\<ThingsBoard install dir\>\conf\thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" if you are using Cassandra database for timeseries data:

```
database:
  ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
  ts:
    type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
```

* Finally, run **upgrade.bat** script to upgrade ThingsBoard to the new version.

**NOTE** Scripts listed above should be executed using Administrator Role.

Execute regular upgrade script:

```text
C:\thingsboard>upgrade.bat --fromVersion=3.3.0
```

Please note that Cassandra 4.x is still in beta. ThingsBoard is compatible with Cassandra 3.x as well.
However, since ThingsBoard 3.2.2+ requires Java 11 and Cassandra 3.x is [not compatible](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/new/java11.html) with Java 8, you **can't launch ThingsBoard 3.2.2+ and Cassandra 3.x on the same machine without separate docker containers for both.**.

**NOTE:** Package installer will ask you to merge your thingsboard configuration. It is preferred to use **merge option** to make sure that all your previous parameters will not be overwritten.  
Please make sure that you set **database.ts.type** parameter value (in the file **/etc/thingsboard/conf/thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" if you are using Cassandra database for timeseries data:

```
database:
  ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
  ts:
    type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
```

**NOTE**: If you were using **Cassandra** database for entities data execute the following migration script: 

```bash
# Execute migration script from Cassandra to PostgreSQL
$ sudo /usr/share/thingsboard/bin/install/upgrade.sh --fromVersion=2.5.0-cassandra
```

Otherwise execute regular upgrade script:

```bash

**NOTE:** If you are using **PostgreSql(Sql)** for time-series data storage before executing the upgrade script, you need to access the psql terminal. Once you will be logged to the psql terminal, please follow the instructions below:

```bash
# Connect to thingsboard database:
\c thingsboard

# Execute the next commands:

# Update ts_kv table constraints:
ALTER TABLE ts_kv DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ts_kv_unq_key;
ALTER TABLE ts_kv DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ts_kv_pkey;
ALTER TABLE ts_kv ADD CONSTRAINT ts_kv_pkey PRIMARY KEY (entity_type, entity_id, key, ts);

# Update ts_kv_latest table constraints:
ALTER TABLE ts_kv_latest DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ts_kv_latest_unq_key;
ALTER TABLE ts_kv_latest DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ts_kv_latest_pkey;
ALTER TABLE ts_kv_latest ADD CONSTRAINT ts_kv_latest_pkey PRIMARY KEY (entity_type, entity_id, key);

# exit psql terminal 
\q
```

* Finally, run **upgrade.bat** script to upgrade ThingsBoard to the new version.

**NOTE** Scripts listed above should be executed using Administrator Role.

```text
C:\thingsboard>upgrade.bat --fromVersion=2.4.3
```

#### Start the service

```text
net start thingsboard
```

## Upgrading to 2.4.3

Please make sure that you set **database.entities.type** and **database.ts.type** parameters values (in the file **/etc/thingsboard/conf/thingsboard.yml**) to "cassandra" instead of "sql" in order to upgrade your cassandra database:
 
```
    database:

        type: "${DATABASE_ENTITIES_TYPE:cassandra}" # cassandra OR sql
      ts:
        type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:cassandra}" # cassandra OR sql (for hybrid mode, only this value should be cassandra)
```

```bash
# Execute upgrade script
$ sudo /usr/share/thingsboard/bin/install/upgrade.sh --fromVersion=2.4.2
