ThingsBoard web interface allows you to configure your company or product logo and color scheme in 2 minutes with zero coding efforts and no service restart required.
The following configuration options are available:
   
  - Configure color scheme, icon and favicon on System Administrator level.
  - Tenant and Customer Administrator UI inherits configuration changes by default.
  - Tenant and Customer Administrators are able to setup their own white-labeling configuration.
  - System and Tenant Administrator are able to setup custom email server settings and customer email templates to interact with the users.
   
Coming soon features:

  - Allow System administrator to enable/disable white-labeling for each tenant
  - Allow Tenant administrator to enable/disable white-labeling for each customer
  - [Contact us](/docs/contact-us/) to suggest missing feature for your use case.
