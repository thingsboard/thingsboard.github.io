## Overview

ThingsBoard allows you to provide Single Sign-On functionality for your customers and automatically create tenants, customers, or sub customers using external user management platforms, that supports the OAuth 2.0 protocol.  
A list of platforms that supports the OAuth 2.0 protocol: [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect), [Okta](https://www.okta.com/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), etc.   


## OAuth 2.0 authentication flow

ThingsBoard supports the Authorization Code grant type to exchange an authorization code for an access token.   
Once the user returns to the ThingsBoard client via redirect URL, the platform will get the authorization code from the URL and will use it to request an access token from the external user management platform.
Using the [basic mapper](/docs/user-guide/oauth-2-support/#basic-mapper) or [custom mapper](/docs/user-guide/oauth-2-support/#custom-mapper), external user info object will be converted from external platform into ThingsBoard internal OAuth 2.0 user. 
After this, the regular ThingsBoard authorization flow will happen.


## Scenario description

In this sample, we are going to use [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect) the authentication. 
The user is going to be logged into the Tenant, and the Tenant name is going to be equal to the user's email.
If the Tenant does not exist in the system, the new Tenant will be created.

As a second step, we are going to add a new external provider for authentication - [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).
In this case, the User is going to be logged into the Tenant which name is going to be equal to a user email domain name.
Additionally, for every user, we are going to create a new Customer and the Customer name is going to be equal to a user email. 

To map that external user info from Google and Auth0 platform, we are going to use a built-in [basic mapper](/docs/user-guide/oauth-2-support/#basic-mapper). 

If [basic mapper](/docs/user-guide/oauth-2-support/#basic-mapper) functionality doesn't fit your business needs, you can configure the [custom mapper](/docs/user-guide/oauth-2-support/#custom-mapper),  so that you are able to add an implementation that fits your specific needs.

### Login with Google

To use Google OAuth 2.0 authentication platform for Login, you need to set up a project in the Google API Console to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials.

Please, follow the instructions on the [OpenID Connect](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect) page to configure the OAuth 2.0 Client.
After completing the instructions above, you should have a new OAuth Client with credentials consisting of a Client ID and a Client Secret.

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/3-client-id.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step3" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

Please, add the ThingsBoard default redirect URI, which we are going to use in this example, to the Authorized Redirect URI section:

```
http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/
```

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/4-Authorized-redirect-uris.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step4" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

#### Configuration of ThingsBoard

Go to your ThingsBoard as a System Administrator (sysadmin@thingsboard.org / sysadmin). Check the General Settings -> Base URL should not contain "/" at the end (f.e. "`http://127.0.0.1:8080`" instead of "`https://127.0.0.1:8080/`"). Then in the **Home** section, find the "OAuth2" icon and click on it.

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/5-home-oauth2.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step5" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

Check the **Enable OAuth2 settings** and click on **+ Add**. Click on *localhost* in the window that appears, for further settings.

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/6-home-oauth2-add.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step6" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

Select the required protocol. If you decide to use the HTTP protocol, be sure to write down its port 8080 in the domain name (localhost:8080).
In this example, we will configure the Google provider. Click on this block.

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/7-oauth2-google.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step7" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

Please provide information (**client ID** and **Client secret**) from your Google API console.
Then expand the **Custom settings** menu.
 
[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/8-login-provider-google.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step8" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

Let's make the settings for the General block. 
Use this [link](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect#discovery) to see the list of up-to-date URLs like **accessTokenUri**, **authorizationUri**, etc.
Select **POST** in the *Client authentication method* field. Then check the "Allow user creation" checkbox. Add to the scope field: *openid, email, profile*. And go to the **Mapper** block.

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/9-oauth2-google-general.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step9" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

Select the **Basic** type and fill in the fields, if necessary (*described in more detail below in this article in the Basic mapper part*).
Some configurations are available only in Professional Edition. Then, **save the settings**.


[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/10-oauth2-google-general-mapper-pe.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step10" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

So that the resulted oauth2 configurations for Google will look similar to the provided below.

If we navigate to the Login screen, we will see an additional Login option with Google:

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/11-login-with-google.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step11" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

Once we click it and select one of our Google Account, we are going to be logged into ThingsBoard with our Google's email as a Tenant Administrator email:

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/12-tenant-administrator.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step12" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

If you log in as the System Administrator, you will see that the Tenant name is our Google's email, according to basic mapper:

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/13-tenants-email.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step13" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

### Login with Auth0

Now let's add one more provider to our list - [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).
This time we are going to create customers for our users inside a single domain tenant.

To use the Auth0 authentication platform for Login, let's create a new application of the 'Regular Web App' type following this [link](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstarts/).

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/14-auth0-regular-web-app.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step14" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

From the list of technologies please select *Java Spring Boot*:

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/15-auth0-java-spring-boot.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step15" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

Once your application is created, you can navigate to application details to obtain **clientId** and **clientSecret**:

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/16-auth0-applications-settings.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step16" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

As well, please update your allowed Callback URLs:

```
http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/
```

**Please, note** that it is not necessary to update the Application login URI.

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/17-auth0_allowed-callback-urls.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step17" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

In the advanced details section you will be able to find all the required URLs (endpoints) for OAuth 2.0 configuration:

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/18-auth0-advanced-settings.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step18" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

#### Configuration of ThingsBoard

Now we can add one more provider:

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/19-oauth2-add-provider.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step19" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

Then select **Custom:**

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/20-oauth2-add-provider-custom.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step20" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

Please provide information (**client ID** and **Client secret**) from your application details, and you may find all the required URLs in the advanced details section.

Select **POST** in the *client authentication method* field. We indicate **Auth0** in the *provider label* field. Then check the “Allow user creation” checkbox. Add to the scope field: *openid, email, profile*. And go to the **Mapper** block.

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/21-oauth2-custom-general.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step21" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

Select the **Basic** type and, if necessary fill in the fields *(described in more detail below in this article in the Basic mapper part).* Some configurations are available only in Professional Edition. Then, **save** the settings.

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/22-oauth2-custom-mapper-pe.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step22" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

So that the resulted oauth2 configurations for OAuth0 will look similar to the provided below.


If we navigate to Login screen, we will see two possible Login with options - **Google** and **Auth0**:

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/23-login-with-auth0.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step23" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

Once we click it and select our *Auth0* Account, we are going to be logged into ThingsBoard with our email's as Customer User:

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/24_customer.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step24" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

If we are logged as System Administrator, you will see that Tenant name is our *Auth0* email domain name, according to basic mapper:

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/25-tenants-emails.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step25" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

We have completed our sample and now your users are not required to create accounts inside ThingsBoard - they can use already exist SSO providers for this.

### Resulted Snipped
This snippet contains both providers that are used in our sample:

## Mapping of the external user into ThingBoard internal user structure

Mapping of the external user info object into ThingBoard user can be achieved in two ways - using the **Basic** and **Custom** mappers. 
The main functionality of the mapper is to map key-value attributes from the external user info object into the expected structure of the ThingsBoard OAuth 2.0 User:

```java
public class OAuth2User {
    private String tenantName;
    private TenantId tenantId;
    private String customerName;
    private CustomerId customerId;
    private String email;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private boolean alwaysFullScreen;
    private String defaultDashboardName;
    
    // NOTE: Next configurations available only in Professional Edition

    private List<String> userGroups;
    private String parentCustomerName;
    private CustomerId parentCustomerId;
}
```

### Basic mapper

A basic mapper is able to merge an external OAuth 2.0 user info object into the ThingsBoard OAuth 2.0 user with a predefined set of rules.

[comment]: <> (![image]&#40;/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/27-oauth2-basic-mapper-pe.png&#41;)
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step27" preview="false" max-width="100%" %}

To use a basic mapper please set *mapperConfig.type* or *SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_TYPE* environment variable to **basic**. 

Here are the details of other properties:

- **allowUserCreation** -
  if this option is set to **true**, then in case, the user account does not exist in the ThingsBoard yet, it will be created.
  If this option is set to **false**, the user will get access denied error, in case, he tries to log in with an external OAuth 2.0 provider, but there is no user on ThingsBoard with those credentials.   
 
- **emailAttributeKey** -
  this is the key to the attributes from the external OAuth 2.0 user info that is going to be used as ThingsBoard user email property.
  
- **firstNameAttributeKey** -
  this is the key to the attributes from the external OAuth 2.0 user info that is going to be used as ThingsBoard user first name property.
    
- **lastNameAttributeKey** -
  this is the key to the attributes from the external OAuth 2.0 user info that is going to be used as ThingsBoard user surname property.

- **tenantNameStrategy** -
  this option specifies which tenant is going to be chosen for creating the user.
  A basic mapper provides three possible options strategy for a generating Tenant name from an external user info object - *domain*, *email*, or *custom*:
     - **domain** - the name of the Tenant will be extracted as the domain from the email of the user;
     - **email** - the name of the Tenant will be the user's email;
     - **custom** - a custom pattern can be set for the Tenant name. Please see *tenantNamePattern*.

- **tenantNamePattern** -
  In case, the *tenantNameStrategy* is **custom** you can specify the name of the Tenant, where the user is going to be created with a help of a custom pattern.
  You can use attributes from the external user info object to put them into the Tenant's name. Please use %{attribute_key} as placeholder for the attribute value.
  
  Tenant pattern examples:
     - **Demo Tenant**           # Hard coded Tenant name;
     - **Demo Tenant %{email}**  # if the user's email is *test@demo.com*, the Tenant's name will be the *'Demo Tenant test@demo.com'*;
     - **%{givenName}**          # if the user's givenName attribute is *Demo User*, the Tenant name will be *'Demo User'*.
        
- **customerNamePattern**
  User can be created under specific Customer, and not under the Tenant if this pattern field is not empty.
  You can use attributes from the external user info object to put them into the Customer name. Please use %{attribute_key} as placeholder for the attribute value.
  
  Customer pattern examples:
     - **Demo Customer**             # Hard coded Customer name;
     - **Demo Customer %{email}**    # If the user's *email* attribute is *test@demo.com*, the Customer name will be *'Demo Customer test@demo.com'*;
     - **%{city}**                   # If the user's *city* attribute is *New York*, the Customer name will be *'New York'*. 

- **defaultDashboardName**
  A user will be redirected to a specific Dashboard if this field is not empty.
  
- **alwaysFullScreen**
  If this field is **true** and **defaultDashboardName** is not empty, the User will be redirected to a specific Dashboard in a fullscreen mode.

- **parentCustomerNamePattern**

  **NOTE: This configuration available only in Professional Edition.**

  The Customer of the user can be created in the hierarchy under this parent Customer if this pattern field is not empty.
  You can use attributes from the external user info object to put them into the Parent Customer name. Please use %{attribute_key} as a placeholder for the attribute value.
  
  Parent Customer pattern examples:
     - **Demo Parent Customer**           # Hard coded Parent Customer name;
     - **Demo Parent Customer %{email}**  # If user's *email* attribute is *test@demo.com*, Parent Customer name is going to be *'Demo Parent Customer test@demo.com'*;
     - **%{country}**                     # If user's *country* attribute is *Top Customer*, Parent Customer name is going to be *'Parent Customer'*. 

- **userGroupsNamePattern**

  **NOTE: This configuration available only in Professional Edition.**

  By default, the newly created user is assigned only to the **All** user's group. 
  You can customize this behavior by specifying a list of groups, where a user has to be assigned to as well. 
  You can use attributes from the external user info object to put them into user group names. Please use %{attribute_key} as placeholder for attribute value.
  If groups don't exist, this group will be created automatically.
  
  User groups pattern examples:
     - **Tenant Administrators, Managers**   # Hard coded user groups;
     - **%{job_title}**                    # If user's *job_title* attribute is *Manager*, user is going to be assigned into *Manager* user group.

### Custom mapper

If the basic mapper functionality doesn't cover your business needs, with the help of the custom mapper you are able to add an implementation that fits your specific goals.

A custom mapper designed as a separate microservice that is running nearby the ThingsBoard core microservice.
ThingsBoard forwards all mapping requests to this microservice and expects as a response ThingsBoard OAuth 2.0 user object:

```java
public class OAuth2User {
    private String tenantName;
    private TenantId tenantId;
    private String customerName;
    private CustomerId customerId;
    private String email;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private boolean alwaysFullScreen;
    private String defaultDashboardName;
    
    // NOTE: Next configurations available only in Professional Edition
    private List<String> userGroups;
    private String parentCustomerName;
    private CustomerId parentCustomerId;
}
```

Please refer to this [base implementation](https://github.com/thingsboard/custom-oauth2-mapper) as a starting point for your custom mapper.

To use the custom mapper please set *mapperConfig.type* or *SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_TYPE* environment variable to **custom**. 

Here are the details of other properties:

- **URL**

  URL of the custom mapper endpoint.

- **username**

  If the custom mapper endpoint configured with basic authorization, specify the *username* in this property.
 
- **password**

  If the custom mapper endpoint configured with basic authorization, specify the *password* in this property.
  
Here is an example of demo configuration:

```bash
  custom:
    url: http://localhost:10010/oauth2/mapper
    username: admin
    password: pa$$word
```

  ...
  balance source # balance must be set to 'source'
  ...
```


As well please configure properly ACL mapping for HTTP and HTTPs requests:
```bash
frontend http-in
  ...
  acl tb_api_acl path_beg /api/ /swagger /webjars /v2/ /static/rulenode/ /oauth2/ /login/oauth2/ # '/oauth2/ /login/oauth2/' added
