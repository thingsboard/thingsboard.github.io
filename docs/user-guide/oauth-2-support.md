## Overview

ThingsBoard allows you to provide Single Sign On functionality for your customers and automatically create tenant, customers or subcustomers using external access management platforms, that supports OAuth 2.0 protocol. As an example of these platforms: [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect), [Okta](https://www.okta.com/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) etc.   


## OAuth 2.0 authentication flow

ThingsBoard supports the Authorization Code grant type to exchange an authorization code for an access token. Once user returns to the ThingsBoard client via redirect URL, the platform will get the authorization code from the URL and use it to request an access token from external user management platform.
Using [basic mapper](/docs/user-guide/oauth-2-support/#basic-mapper) or [custom mapper](/docs/user-guide/oauth-2-support/#custom-mapper) external user object will be converted from external system into ThingsBoard internal user and then regular ThingsBoard authorization flow will happen.

## Scenario description

In this sample we are going to use [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect) for authentication. 
User is going to be logged into the Tenant and Tenant name is going to be equal to the user's email.
If Tenant is not exist in the system, the newly Tenant is going to be created.

As a second step we are going to add a new external provider for authentication - [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).
In this case User is going to be logged into the Tenant which name is going to be equal to user's email domain name.
Additionally, for every user we are going to create a new Customer and Customer name is going to be user's email. 

To map these external users from Google and Auth0 platform we are going to use built-in [basic mapper](/docs/user-guide/oauth-2-support/#basic-mapper). 

If [basic mapper](/docs/user-guide/oauth-2-support/#basic-mapper) functionality will not fit your business needs, with the help of [custom mapper](/docs/user-guide/oauth-2-support/#custom-mapper) you are able to add an implementation that fits your specific goals.

### Login with Google

To use Googleâ€™s OAuth 2.0 authentication platform for Login, you must set up a project in the Google API Console to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials.

Please follow the instructions on the [OpenID Connect](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect) page.
After completing the instructions above, you should have a new OAuth Client with credentials consisting of a Client ID and a Client Secret.

Please add to Authorized redirect URIs section default ThingsBoard redirect URI that we are going to use in this sample:

```
http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/
```

#### Configuration of ThingsBoard

You will need to modify OAuth 2 parameters in [thingsboard.yml](/docs/user-guide/install/config/#thingsboardyml)

```bash
# Security parameters
security:
  ...
  oauth2:
    # Enable/disable OAuth 2 login functionality

            password: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_CUSTOM_PASSWORD:}"
```

Please modify this section with information (**clientId** and **clientSecret**) from your Google API console.

Use this [link](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect#discovery) to see the list of up-to-date URLs like **accessTokenUri**, **authorizationUri** etc. 

Here is the list of modified parameters:

```bash
# Security parameters
security:
  ...
  oauth2:
    enabled: true
    loginProcessingUrl: /login/oauth2/code/
    clients:
      default:
        loginButtonLabel: Google
        loginButtonIcon: mdi:google
        clientName: TB Google test
        clientId: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        clientSecret: YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
        accessTokenUri: https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
        authorizationUri: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
        scope: openid,email,profile
        redirectUriTemplate: http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/
        jwkSetUri: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs
        authorizationGrantType: authorization_code
        clientAuthenticationMethod: post
        userInfoUri: https://openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo
        userNameAttributeName: email
        mapperConfig:
          type: basic
          allowUserCreation: true
          activateUser: false
          basic:
            emailAttributeKey: email
            firstNameAttributeKey: given_name
            lastNameAttributeKey: family_name
            tenantNameStrategy: custom
            tenantNamePattern:
            customerNamePattern:
            #
            # NOTE: Next configurations available only in Professional Edition
            #
            parentCustomerNamePattern:
            userGroupsNamePattern: Tenant Administators
          custom:
            url:
            username:
            password:
```

If we navigate to Login screen, we will see additional Login option with Google:

![image](/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/login-with-google.png)

Once we click it and select on of our Google Account, we are going to be logged into ThingsBoard with our Google's email as Tenant Administrator email:

![image](/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/google-email.png)

If we logged as System Administrator, you will see that Tenant name is our Google email's, according to basic mapper:

![image](/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/tenant-title-as-email.png)

### Login with Auth0

Now let's add one more SSO provider to our list - [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).
This time we are going to create Customers for our users inside a single domain tenant.

To use Auth0 authentication platform for Login, let's create new application of 'Regular Web App' type following this [link](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstarts/).

![image](/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/auth0-regular-app.png)

From the list of technology please select *Java Spring Security*:

![image](/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/auth0-spring-security.png)

Once your application will be created you can navigate to application details to obtain **clientId** and **clientSecret**:

![image](/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/auth0-app-details.png)

As well please update you allowed Callback URLs:

```
http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/
```

![image](/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/auth0-allowed-redirect.png)

In the advanced details section you'll be able to find all the required URLs (endpoints) for OAuth 2.0 configuration:

![image](/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/auth0-advanced-endpoints.png)

#### Configuration of ThingsBoard

Now it's time to update [thingsboard.yml](/docs/user-guide/install/config/#thingsboardyml) with the additional SSO provider. 
This snippet contains both providers that are used in our sample:

```bash
# Security parameters
security:
  ...
  oauth2:
    enabled: true
    loginProcessingUrl: /login/oauth2/code/
    clients:
      google:
        loginButtonLabel: Google
        loginButtonIcon: mdi:google
        clientName: TB Google test
        clientId: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        clientSecret: YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
        accessTokenUri: https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
        authorizationUri: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
        scope: openid,email,profile
        redirectUriTemplate: http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/
        jwkSetUri: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs
        authorizationGrantType: authorization_code
        clientAuthenticationMethod: post
        userInfoUri: https://openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo
        userNameAttributeName: email
        mapperConfig:
          type: basic
          allowUserCreation: true
          activateUser: false
          basic:
            emailAttributeKey: email
            firstNameAttributeKey: given_name
            lastNameAttributeKey: family_name
            tenantNameStrategy: email
            tenantNamePattern:
            customerNamePattern:
            #
            # NOTE: Next configurations available only in Professional Edition
            #
            parentCustomerNamePattern:
            userGroupsNamePattern: Tenant Administators
          custom:
            url:
            username:
            password:
      auth0:
        loginButtonLabel: Auth0
        loginButtonIcon: mdi:shield-account
        clientName: My App
        clientId: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        clientSecret: YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
        accessTokenUri: https://dev-jwnt7l67.auth0.com/oauth/token
        authorizationUri: https://dev-jwnt7l67.auth0.com/authorize
        scope: openid,email,profile
        redirectUriTemplate: http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/
        jwkSetUri: https://dev-jwnt7l67.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json
        authorizationGrantType: authorization_code
        clientAuthenticationMethod: post
        userInfoUri: https://dev-jwnt7l67.auth0.com/userinfo
        userNameAttributeName: email
        mapperConfig:
          type: basic
          allowUserCreation: true
          activateUser: false
          basic:
            emailAttributeKey: email
            firstNameAttributeKey: 
            lastNameAttributeKey: 
            tenantNameStrategy: domain
            tenantNamePattern:
            customerNamePattern: %{email}
            #
            # NOTE: Next configurations available only in Professional Edition
            #
            parentCustomerNamePattern:
            userGroupsNamePattern: Customer Users
          custom:
            url:
            username:
            password:
```

If we navigate to Login screen, we will see two possible Login with options - *Google* and *Auth0*:

![image](/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/login-with-google-and-auth0.png)

Once we click it and select our *Auth0* Account, we are going to be logged into ThingsBoard with our email's as Customer User:

![image](/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/customer-email.png)

If we logged as System Administrator, you will see that Tenant name is our *Auth0* email domain name, according to basic mapper:

![image](/images/user-guide/oauth-2-support/tenant-title-as-domain.png)

We have completed our sample and now your users not required to create accounts inside ThingsBoard - they can use already exist SSO providers for this.

## Mapping of external user into ThingBoard internal user structure

Mapping of the external user object into ThingBoard user can be achieved in two ways - using **Basic** and **Custom** mappers. 
Main functionality of the mapper is to map key-value attributes from the external user information object into expected structure of the ThingsBoard OAuth 2 User:

```java
public class OAuth2User {
    private String tenantName;
    private TenantId tenantId;
    private String customerName;
    private CustomerId customerId;
    private String email;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    
    // NOTE: Next configurations available only in Professional Edition
    private List<String> userGroups;
    private String parentCustomerName;
    private CustomerId parentCustomerId;
}
```

### Basic mapper

A Basic mapper is able to merge external OAuth 2.0 user into ThingsBoard OAuth 2.0 user with a predefined set of rules. 
Configuration of this mapper done over [thingsboard.yml](/docs/user-guide/install/config/#thingsboardyml):

```bash
mapperConfig:
  # Allows to create user if it not exists
  allowUserCreation: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_ALLOW_USER_CREATION:true}"
  # Allows user to setup ThingsBoard internal password and login over default Login window
  activateUser: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_ACTIVATE_USER:false}"
  # Mapper type of converter from external user into internal - 'basic' or 'custom'
  type: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_TYPE:basic}"
  basic:
    # Key from attributes of external user object to use as email
    emailAttributeKey: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_BASIC_EMAIL_ATTRIBUTE_KEY:email}"
    firstNameAttributeKey: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_BASIC_FIRST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE_KEY:}"
    lastNameAttributeKey: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_BASIC_LAST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE_KEY:}"
    # Strategy for generating Tenant from external user object - 'domain', 'email' or 'custom'
    # 'domain' - name of the Tenant will be extracted as domain from the email of the user
    # 'email' - name of the Tenant will email of the user
    # 'custom' - please configure 'tenantNamePattern' for custom mapping
    tenantNameStrategy: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_BASIC_TENANT_NAME_STRATEGY:domain}"
    # %{attribute_key} as placeholder for attribute value of attributes of external user object
    tenantNamePattern: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_BASIC_TENANT_NAME_PATTERN:}"
    # If this field is not empty, user will be created as a user under defined Customer
    # %{attribute_key} as placeholder for attribute value of attributes of external user object
    customerNamePattern: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_BASIC_CUSTOMER_NAME_PATTERN:}"
    # 
    # NOTE: Next configurations available only in Professional Edition
    #
    # If this field is not empty, Customer will be created in the hierarchy under this parent Customer
    # %{attribute_key} as placeholder for attributes value by key
    parentCustomerNamePattern: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_BASIC_PARENT_CUSTOMER_NAME_PATTERN:}"
    # User will be added to the All group of the owner and additional to all groups, provided in this list
    # List of comma separated user group names, %{attribute_key} as placeholder for attributes value by key
    userGroupsNamePattern: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_BASIC_USER_GROUPS_NAME_PATTERN:Tenant Administrators}" 
```

To use Basic mapper please set **mapperConfig.type** or **SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_TYPE** environment variable to **basic**. 

Here are the details of other properties:

- **allowUserCreation**
  If this option set to **true**, then if user account doesn't exist in the ThingsBoard yet, it's going to be created.
  If this option set to **false**, user will get access denied error if he tries to login with external OAuth 2.0 provider, but user doesn't exist yet.   
 
- **emailAttributeKey**
  This is the key of the attributes from the external OAuth 2.0 user that is going to be used as ThingsBoard user email property.
  
- **firstNameAttributeKey**
  This is the key of the attributes from the external OAuth 2.0 user that is going to be used as ThingsBoard user first name property.
    
- **lastNameAttributeKey**
  This is the key of the attributes from the external OAuth 2.0 user that is going to be used as ThingsBoard user surname property.

- **tenantNameStrategy**
  This option specifies which tenant is going to be chosen for creating of the user.
  A Basic mapper provide three possible options strategy for generating Tenant name from external user object - *domain*, *email* or *custom*.
     - **domain** - name of the Tenant will be extracted as domain from the email of the user
     - **email** - name of the Tenant will email of the user
     - **custom** - you can define a custom pattern for Tenant name. Please see *tenantNamePattern*.

- **tenantNamePattern**
  In case *tenantNameStrategy* is **custom** you can specify a name of the Tenant where user is going to be created with a help of custom pattern.
  You can use attributes from the external user object to put them into Tenant name. Please use %{attribute_key} as placeholder for attribute value.
  
  Tenant pattern examples:
     - **Demo Tenant**           # Hard coded Tenant name
     - **Demo Tenant %{email}**  # In this case if user's email is *test@demo.com*, Tenant name is going to be *'Demo Tenant test@demo.com'*
     - **%{givenName}**            # In this case if user's givenName is *Demo User*, Tenant name is going to be *'Demo User'* 
        
- **customerNamePattern**
  User can be created under specific Customer, and not under the Tenant, if this pattern field is not empty.
  You can use attributes from the external user object to put them into Customer name. Please use %{attribute_key} as placeholder for attribute value.
  
  Customer pattern examples:
     - **Demo Customer**             # Hard coded Customer name
     - **Demo Customer %{email}**    # If user's *email* attribute is *test@demo.com*, Customer name is going to be *'Demo Customer test@demo.com'*
     - **%{city}**                   # If user's *city* attribute is *New York*, Customer name is going to be *'New York'* 

- **parentCustomerNamePattern**

  **NOTE: This configuration available only in Professional Edition**

  Customer of the user can be created in the hierarchy under this parent Customer, if this pattern field is not empty.
  You can use attributes from the external user object to put them into Parent Customer name. Please use %{attribute_key} as placeholder for attribute value.
  
  Parent Customer pattern examples:
     - **Demo Parent Customer**           # Hard coded Parent Customer name
     - **Demo Parent Customer %{email}**  # If user's *email* attribute is *test@demo.com*, Parent Customer name is going to be *'Demo Parent Customer test@demo.com'*
     - **%{country}**                     # If user's *country* attribute is *Top Customer*, Parent Customer name is going to be *'Parent Customer'* 

- **userGroupsNamePattern**

  **NOTE: This configuration available only in Professional Edition**

  By default, newly created user will be assigned only to the **All** user's group. 
  You can customize this behaviour by specifying list of groups, where user must be assigned to as well. 
  You can use attributes from the external user object to put them into user group names. Please use %{attribute_key} as placeholder for attribute value.
  If groups doesn't exist, this group will be created automatically.
  
  User groups pattern examples:
     - **Tenant Administrators, Managers**   # Hard coded user groups
     - **%{job_title}**                    # If user's *job_title* attribute is *Manager*, user is going to be assigned into *Manager* user group.

### Custom mapper

If basic mapper functionality doesn't cover your business needs, with the help of custom mapper you are able to add an implementation that fits your specific goals.

A custom mapper designed as a separate microservice which is running nearby the ThingsBoard core microservice.
ThingsBoard forwards all mapping requests to this microservice and expects as a response ThingsBoard OAuth 2 user object:

```java
public class OAuth2User {
    private String tenantName;
    private TenantId tenantId;
    private String customerName;
    private CustomerId customerId;
    private String email;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    
    // NOTE: Next configurations available only in Professional Edition
    private List<String> userGroups;
    private String parentCustomerName;
    private CustomerId parentCustomerId;
}
```

Please use this [base implementation](https://github.com/thingsboard/custom-oauth2-mapper) as a starting point for your custom mapper.

Configuration of this mapper done over [thingsboard.yml](/docs/user-guide/install/config/#thingsboardyml):

```bash
mapperConfig:
  # Allows to create user if it not exists
  allowUserCreation: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_ALLOW_USER_CREATION:true}"
  # Allows user to setup ThingsBoard internal password and login over default Login window
  activateUser: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_ACTIVATE_USER:false}"
  # Mapper type of converter from external user into internal - 'basic' or 'custom'
  type: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_TYPE:custom}"
  custom:
    url: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_CUSTOM_URL:}"
    username: "${SECURITY_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_MAPPER_CUSTOM_USERNAME:}"
