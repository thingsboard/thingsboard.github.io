            <h2>What is IoT Device Management?</h2>
            <div class="text-content medium-margin">IoT device management is controlling all aspects of a connected device from a single location. It includes devices like sensors, meters, PLCs, connected equipment, CCTV cameras, portals, and processors. The services supported by the IoT device management platform include registration and provisioning, inventory control, remote configuration, and firmware upgrades.</div>
            <div class="text-content medium-margin">Collecting location and usage data from managed IoT devices is an essential part of device management. This data is then analyzed for maintenance, repair, optimization, or replacement. Effective cost management becomes increasingly important as more IoT devices are integrated into mission-critical processes.</div>
            <div class="text-content medium-margin">IoT device management system refers to the tasks and interconnected functions related to the setup, configuration, and maintenance of these devices. These tasks include device setup, admin and monitoring of device fleets, and managing the device through its lifecycle.</div>
            <h2 class="line-height-small">Simplify Your Control with IoT Device Management Tools</h2>
            <div class="text-content medium-margin">Good device management platform IoT must provide simple instruments to monitor device state like connectivity status, packet losses, battery level, etc. Those metrics can be used to trigger alerts and notifications in case of abnormal behaviour, device failure or configured events. Also, it is important to have the possibility to monitor device data flow and analyze historical and real-time data.</div>
            <div class="text-content medium-margin">ThingsBoard device management supports a variety of direct communication <a class="article-link" href="/docs/pe/api/">protocols</a> for interaction between devices and the IoT platform — MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, LWM2M, OPC-UA, Modbus, etc. Those protocols are already industry standards. However, we do support other options — SNMP, Kafka, TCP/UDP.</div>
            <div class="text-content">We also <a class="article-link" href="/docs/user-guide/integrations/">accept devices</a> from external connectivity IoT device management companies like LoRaWAN, Sigfox, NB-IoT, AWS IoT, Azure IoT, Actility ThingPark, TheThingsStack, OceanConnect, etc.</div>
