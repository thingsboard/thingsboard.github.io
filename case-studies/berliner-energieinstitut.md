                <h3>ThingsBoard discovered at a critical moment</h3>
                <p>At the time, Berliner Energieinstitut GmbH was experiencing significant challenges in setting up a reliable and scalable IoT infrastructure. The in-house implementation attempts were proving to be complex and resource-intensive. That’s when ThingsBoard entered the picture - almost by chance. The platform had just been released as version 1.0, and despite its early stage, it immediately caught their attention.</p>

                <p>Berliner Energieinstitut required several specific customisations: tailored frontend components and extensive modifications to the backend. After only a few email exchanges with the ThingsBoard team, it became clear that the platform offered exactly what was needed. The required functionality was not just theoretically possible but was actually implemented in a matter of weeks.</p>
