                <p>SuessCo Sensors GmbH, established in 2018 and located in Herzogenburg, Austria, is a leader in sensor technology innovation. They created the world's first 6D sensor, a groundbreaking device that uses magnetic field technology and artificial intelligence to monitor the health of structures. This includes detecting cracks and tracking the movements of bridges, historical buildings, and other important infrastructure. These sensors are widely used in construction, transportation, and industrial applications to enhance safety and extend the lifespan of infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>What problem did they face?</h2>
            <p>SuessCo Sensors GmbH faced a big challenge: how to provide accurate monitoring for important structures like bridges, historical buildings, and government monuments in Austria. Traditional methods relied on manual inspections, which were slow, required a lot of work, and often missed small but important details. They also couldn’t show real-time changes, which made it harder to act quickly and prevent problems. SuessCo’s clients include construction companies, infrastructure operators, and owners of old buildings such as churches or dioceses. These clients needed real-time data to understand and predict how structures might change due to weather or other conditions. <br> <br> Earlier, SuessCo’s sensors could only measure in two dimensions. The new 6D sensor changed everything. Using magnetic field technology, it can now measure both straight movements and rotations. However, using this advanced sensor created another challenge: SuessCo needed a powerful system to process, store, and analyze the large amount of data the sensor produced.</p>

                <h3>Advanced monitoring for 6D sensors</h3>
                <p>ThingsBoard, provided by Magenta Business, played a key role in helping SuessCo create an advanced monitoring system. This IoT platform made it easier to manage the complex data and requirements of SuessCo’s 6D sensors. These sensors measure movements and rotations in different dimensions, which requires precise calculations. ThingsBoard processed this data in real-time, ensuring accurate results no matter how the sensors were installed. This helped SuessCo provide reliable insights for monitoring infrastructure.</p>

            <p>"This is a world first, because it is a very disruptive technology," says Windhör. "Until now, there were only sensors that could measure the change in a crack in one direction. Our sensor can measure in 6 dimensions and therefore map the deviations much more precisely."</p>
