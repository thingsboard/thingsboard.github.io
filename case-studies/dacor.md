                <h3>Seamless integration with industrial equipment</h3>
                <p>ThingsBoard’s open architecture and support for standard industrial protocols enabled smooth integration with the customer’s production line. In this project, a software trigger was embedded into each machine’s control program to capture the milling motor's power status, which was then collected via a ThingsBoard-compatible IoT module — ensuring reliable data acquisition at the source.</p>

                <h3>Real-Time telemetry & dashboards</h3>
                <p>ThingsBoard enables real-time collection, visualization, and analysis of telemetry data from our LoRaWAN sensors and IoT modules. With fully customizable dashboards, we can monitor live sensor readings such as temperature, humidity, fill levels, or switching states. Deviations or critical values are highlighted immediately, allowing fast responses and situational awareness.</p>

                <p>ThingsBoard includes a highly capable rule engine, which we actively use to automate data workflows. We rely on it to aggregate raw sensor data and calculate key performance metrics such as uptime, utilization, or operational KPIs. This allows complex processes—like tracking run-times or generating daily consumption summaries—to be fully automated and displayed in dashboards or reports. Most logic is built using the visual rule chain editor, reducing the need for manual coding.</p>

                <h3>Asset & entity management</h3>
                <p>Our LoRaWAN sensors are logically organized into device groups in ThingsBoard to maintain a clear and manageable structure. These groups are typically based on location, customer site, or application type. This organization makes it easier to aggregate performance data, analyze trends, and present targeted information. Grouping simplifies dashboarding and reporting while improving overall clarity and data interpretation.</p>

                <p>Rather than using detailed role-based permissions, we take advantage of ThingsBoard’s public dashboard links to provide real-time access to key operational views. For example, a production overview dashboard is displayed on a central control room screen, continuously showing current machine states without requiring login credentials. This approach has proven extremely effective in offering staff a quick, up-to-date overview of production activity at a glance.</p>
