        <h2>How ThingsBoard helps telecom improve operations with IoT?</h2>
        <div class="block">
            <div class="text">
                <h3>Remote monitoring of telecom infrastructure</h3>
                <p>With networks distributed across wide geographies, telecom providers require real-time monitoring of thousands of remote assets such as base stations, towers, and data centers. ThingsBoard enables centralized visibility and automated alerts across the entire infrastructure.</p>
                <p>How It Works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>IoT gateways and sensors are connected to telecom towers, power systems, UPS, HVAC, and access doors.</li>
                    <li>ThingsBoard collects data from all sites and presents it on custom dashboards.</li>
                    <li>Rule Engine triggers real-time alarms when anomalies or failures occur.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Energy management for remote sites</h3>
                <p>Telecom infrastructure is highly energy-intensive, especially in remote or off-grid locations. ThingsBoard enables smart energy monitoring and optimization, helping operators lower fuel usage, reduce emissions, and cut costs.</p>
                <p>How It Works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smart meters, solar panels, diesel generators, and battery banks are connected via IoT.</li>
                    <li>ThingsBoard visualizes energy consumption, generator runtime, fuel levels, and battery health.</li>
                    <li>Automatic alerts warn of power failures, overloads, or low battery voltage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Predictive maintenance of network equipment</h3>
                <p>Network outages and equipment failure can lead to major revenue loss and customer churn. ThingsBoard supports predictive maintenance for telecom gear—helping teams resolve issues before downtime occurs.</p>
                <p>How It Works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sensors track equipment temperature, vibration, runtime, and fault codes from BTS, routers, UPS, etc.</li>
                    <li>Maintenance teams receive early alerts, enabling scheduled servicing instead of reactive repair.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Site access control & security</h3>
                <p>Many telecom sites use legacy PLCs and SCADA systems for managing HVAC, power, and environmental control. ThingsBoard provides SCADA-style capabilities for modern visualization and automation.</p>
                <p>How It Works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supports SCADA symbols and layout editors to create interactive site dashboards.</li>
                    <li>Operators can control relays, HVAC, or lighting remotely through the UI.</li>
