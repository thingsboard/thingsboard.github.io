                <h3>Beer tanks monitoring</h3>
                <p>To address the challenge of tracking beer levels in beer tanks at restaurants, ThingsBoard implemented a comprehensive solution to monitor the sensors which SBG deployed on beer tanks. Key metrics include remaining stock, pressure, and battery levels. Real-time monitoring dashboards provided immediate insights into stock status, while alert notifications ensured users were informed whenever beer levels dropped below predefined thresholds, enabling timely replenishment.</p>

                <h3>Vehicle management</h3>
                <p>To manage beer delivery logistics effectively, ThingsBoard developed a fully integrated solution. SBG implemented a real-time vehicle tracking system, using GPS data to monitor the locations and movements of trucks. ThingsBoard created dashboards to display vital metrics, such as battery levels, beer stock, and delivery statuses, ensuring that stakeholders always had a clear overview. Additional logic segmented data per trip, which helped to visualize and report delivery operations more efficiently.</p>

                <h3>Alert and notification systems</h3>
                <p>To improve responsiveness to critical events, ThingsBoard implemented a unified alert system that included email and web-based notifications to inform users about low stock levels, vehicle issues, and potential keg tampering. Mobile notification extensions were also added to provide real-time updates on the go, ensuring users stayed informed regardless of their location. Additionally, the system allowed for customizable alert preferences, enabling users to tailor notifications based on their specific roles and responsibilities.

            <p>“At Super Bock Bebidas, S.A. we pride ourselves on our ability to adapt, innovate, and stay ahead of the curve. We have been using in-house beer drive tanks and tracking systems for many years. It served us well, but as the times evolved, we realized our system had become outdated, lacking the efficiency we desired. That's when we discovered ThingsBoard.”</p>

                <p>Two key functionalities were additionally developed</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Synchronization logic to integrate restaurant data from Super Bock Group’s systems into ThingsBoard, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Predictive rule nodes to estimate when beer levels would fall below acceptable thresholds, streamlining replenishment schedules.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>To address the challenge of assigning kegs to restaurants, sensors transmitted geolocation data derived from nearby Wi-Fi points and cellular towers. This data was processed using Google APIs to generate approximate GPS coordinates. These coordinates helped improve the accuracy of keg tracking, ensuring they were associated with the right locations. In future iterations, keg assignments are expected to be fully automated based on proximity to restaurant locations, streamlining the distribution process further.</p>
                <p class="quote-text">The decision to migrate to ThingsBoard's platform was not made lightly but was supported by the ThingsBoard team’s ability to listen, understand their needs, and propose a tailored solution.</p>
