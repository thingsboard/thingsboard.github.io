                <h3>Scalable growth made simple</h3>
                <p>ThingsBoard played an important role in helping Oneserve transform and improve its field service management solution. As Oneserve continued to grow, they needed a platform that could keep up with their increasing demands without making their systems more complicated or expensive. ThingsBoard provided exactly what they needed — a flexible, powerful, and easy-to-use IoT platform that fit their business strategy perfectly.</p>

                <h3>Centralized monitoring and management</h3>
                <p>Facility operators deal with multiple disparate systems: HVAC, lighting, security, water supply, and more. ThingsBoard unifies these into a single platform, allowing seamless management of all processes through a user-friendly interface.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>You connect sensors for temperature, humidity, motion, water consumption, and other parameters.</p></li>
                    <li><p>All data is aggregated and visualized on customizable dashboards.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Automated alerts and system responses can be configured (e.g., turning on ventilation when CO₂ levels rise).</p></li>
