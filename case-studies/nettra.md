Not only Thingsboard had all the functionalities we had already developed, but also included many more that were on our pipeline for the coming months. Switching to Thingsboard was a no-brainer. <br> The platform has proven to be very reliable, with great support and constant evolution. Definitely the right choice for our company."</p>

        <h2>How ThingsBoard helps smart energy improve operations?</h2>
        <div class="block">
            <div class="text">
                <h3>One platform for all energy devices</h3>
                <p>ThingsBoard makes it much easier for smart energy companies to manage their operations. Instead of juggling different systems for different types of devices, companies can connect everything into one platform. ThingsBoard supports all the major communication protocols - like MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, LwM2M, SNMP, Modbus, and OPC-UA - which means it can easily work with a wide range of energy devices without any extra hassle.</p>

                <h3>Reliable offline with Edge and OTA</h3>
                <p>For locations where internet access is limited, ThingsBoard offers edge computing. This means data can be processed locally, improving reliability and reducing delays. Over-the-air (OTA) updates allow companies to remotely update device software and settings, saving time and reducing maintenance costs.</p>
