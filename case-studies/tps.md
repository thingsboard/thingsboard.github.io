                <p>Whether managing utility systems, building equipment, security devices, or exhibit environments, ThingsBoard consolidates all data into unified dashboards for real-time visibility and management.</p>
                <p>How It Works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Integrate devices and sensors for HVAC, lighting, environmental monitoring, and security.</li>
                    <li>Display all operational data in a single, customizable dashboard.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Monitor equipment status in real time via sensors.</li>
                    <li>Detect abnormal behavior (temperature rise, increased vibration) before failures.</li>

                <p>How It Works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Connect smart meters, lighting controllers, HVAC systems.</li>
                    <li>Analyze energy use by building, time, or function.</li>

                <p>How It Works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collect real-time data on CO₂, PM2.5, humidity, and temperature.</li>
