            <h2>What problem did they face?</h2>
            <p>Before using a standard IoT stack, customers of any industry struggled with IoT-projects, because they had fragmented sensor data on different proprietary platforms, and lengthy integration projects with questionable return on investment. There was no way to gain transparency across decentralized infrastructures with IoT that was fast, scalable, and affordable.</p>

        <h2>How ThingsBoard powers KIOTERA?</h2>
        <div class="block">
            <div class="text">
                <h3>Energy monitoring across distributed assets</h3>
                <p>KIOTERA deploys LoRaWAN plug-and-play sensors that capture data on energy consumption. The ThingsBoard based modules provides standardised visualisations such as daily energy usage, cumulative meter readings and consumption trends over time. This gives operational teams a clear and transparent overview of how energy is used across distributed assets—supporting audits, sustainability reporting and operational planning.</p>

                <h3>Condition monitoring for industrial machines</h3>
                <p>KIOTERA integrates vibration and temperature sensors to monitor industrial equipment such as motors, pumps, fans, and compressors. ThingsBoard acts as the central platform for processing and visualising machine health indicators. Dashboards display vibration levels and temperature trends, while the rule engine detects deviations and triggers maintenance alerts. This enables companies to move from interval-based servicing to condition-based maintenance, which significantly reduces downtime and costs, while extending equipment life and improving overall equipment effectiveness.</p>

                <h3>District heating & utility monitoring</h3>
                <p>Utility providers rely on data from a variety of distributed meters, including those for district heating, gas and water. Standardized visualisations enables operators to monitor flow rates and temperatures across decentralised infrastructures. ThingsBoard serves as the central data hub, aggregating meter values from different manufacturers and communication standards into a unified, scalable system. Automated alerts notify operators of anomalies such as unexpected consumption spikes, pressure drops or temperature deviations in district heating loops. This enables utilities to respond quickly, reduce losses and maintain higher system reliability.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Universal device connectivity</h3>
                <p>ThingsBoard supports all major IoT communication standards like LoRaWAN, MQTT, NB-IoT, HTTP, and Modbus allowing KIOTERA to integrate sensors and meters from virtually any manufacturer. This vendor independence is essential for real-world deployments, where legacy equipment and modern IoT devices must coexist.</p>

                <h3>Reusable assets for faster rollouts</h3>
                <p>ThingsBoard allows KIOTERA to develop reusable telemetry models, device profiles, rule chains and dashboards, which can be deployed across various sites and use cases.</p>
                <p>This standardisation reduces project delivery time while ensuring that every installation follows a proven and scalable architecture. Meanwhile, ThingsBoard remains fully customisable, enabling KIOTERA to extend modules whenever customers require industry-specific logic or visualisations.</p>
