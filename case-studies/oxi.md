            <div class="text">
                <h3>Customized IoT backbone for pellet burner operations</h3>
                <p>ThingsBoard serves as the backbone of OXI TRADE's IoT infrastructure, providing all the tools necessary to connect, manage, and operate their pellet burner devices. The platform was tailored to meet the company’s specific requirements, ensuring flexibility, automation, and effective collaboration across OXI TRADE’s distribution network.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Seamless and scalable device provisioning</h3>
                <p>One of the key features is automated device provisioning. ThingsBoard enables OXI TRADE’s pellet burners to self-register upon activation. Each device, pre-configured with unique credentials, sends a provisioning request with a secure key and secret to ThingsBoard. Once validated, the platform registers the device, assigns proper credentials, and integrates it into the system—without any manual setup. This smooth process makes it easy to scale and reduces the amount of administrative effort.</p>

                <h3>Role-based access for the entire distribution network</h3>
                <p>To support its expanding network of partners and customers, OXI TRADE required a way to manage multiple user roles across the entire distribution chain. ThingsBoard delivered a clear and flexible user hierarchy aligned with the company’s business model. As the main system owner (tenant), OXI TRADE has full control over all devices and user groups. Distributors operate under the tenant and manage their respective resellers, assign devices, and oversee performance in their regions. Resellers, in turn, support end customers and help them connect their devices. Customers have access only to their own equipment, while service departments are granted extended permissions to perform remote configurations, diagnostics, and technical support. This role-based model enables OXI TRADE to securely and efficiently manage thousands of devices and users from one centralized platform.</p>

                <h3>Real-time monitoring and remote control via dashboards</h3>
                <p>Using ThingsBoard dashboards, OXI TRADE and its partners can monitor all connected pellet burners in real-time. Depending on their access level, users—whether customers, resellers, or service teams—can view key device data, such as operational mode, temperature, and overall system status. This insight helps users stay informed and proactive. In addition to monitoring, they can also control devices remotely. Common actions include starting or stopping a device, triggering the fuel feeder, or adjusting temperature settings. All of this can be done through the platform, without being physically present near the equipment. Remote control capabilities save time, reduce service visits, and enable quicker responses to customer needs and technical issues.</p>

                <h3>Proactive alert management and full system accountability</h3>
                <p>Devices also report real-time alerts for critical issues, such as fuel shortages, overheating, sensor failures, or controller malfunctions. ThingsBoard categorizes and logs these alerts, allowing service teams to respond quickly. Alongside alert management, the platform maintains a detailed log of all user actions. This audit logging feature gives OXI TRADE full visibility into every command sent through the system—such as configuration changes, operational commands, or remote updates. These logs help the company trace exactly what actions were taken, by whom, and when. If a device experiences problems, OXI TRADE can review the history to identify whether an incorrect user action or misconfiguration was the cause. This improves accountability across all user levels and simplifies troubleshooting.</p>
