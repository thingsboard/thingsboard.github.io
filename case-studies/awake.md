                <p>Awake develops, manufactures, and distributes electric Jetboards and eFoils to a global industry, with a retailer network consisting of over 50 dealers, covering all continents except for the poles. Awake was founded in 2018 by three young Swedes seeking to simplify access to powered water sports. It all started back in 2012, when one of the founders, Philip Werner, built his first prototype, made from an old windsurfing board, an RC system, and some lithium-ion batteries.</p>
                <p>Now, Awake is a formidable force in the world of electric water sports, boasting a global reach through its retailer network and a brand recognized for performance, quality, and outstanding design. Awake is a forward-leaning development company that continually pushes the boundaries of what is possible within the electric water sports space.</p>

In essence, Awake needed to build a new operational foundation from scratch to successfully launch and scale this innovative business approach.</p>

                <h3>One hub for operations</h3>

Every rental location, piece of equipment, and financial record is connected in one place, giving managers instant clarity and freeing them from manual data collection. This <a class="invisible" target="_blank" href="/services/development-services/">rental management software</a> ensures decisions are based on real-time facts — not assumptions.</p>
