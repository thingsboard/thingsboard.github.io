                <h3>Digital transformation for smarter farming</h3>
                <p>ThingsBoard empowers agricultural businesses to transition from manual processes to data-driven, automated operations. The platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools that enable real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and smart automation across farms, greenhouses, storage facilities, and field equipment. One of the most powerful features of ThingsBoard is its interactive dashboards, which allow users to visualise live and historical data from soil sensors, weather stations, machinery, and other connected devices. These dashboards can be customised using an extensive widget library and built with dynamic layouts to create intuitive, responsive interfaces for different user roles and devices.</p>

                <h3>Automating agriculture with Rule Engine 2.0</h3>
                <p>The Rule Engine 2.0 plays a central role in enabling smart automation. It allows users to create low-code workflows that react to incoming data in real time. For example, irrigation systems can automatically activate based on soil moisture thresholds, or alerts can be triggered when storage temperatures exceed safe ranges. These workflows use a visual editor, making them accessible even to non-developers.</p>
