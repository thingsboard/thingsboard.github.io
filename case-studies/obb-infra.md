                <p>As Austria's pioneer rail transport provider, ÖBB-Infrastruktur AG is responsible for planning, developing, maintaining, and operating Austria's rail infrastructure. The company is committed to setting high standards for punctuality, safety, cleanliness, and open access to the rail system.</p>
                <p>With innovation and sustainability in mind, ÖBB-Infrastruktur AG ensures that millions of passengers travel comfortably and enables efficient transportation of goods across Austria and beyond. The goal is simple: make every journey a good experience, create welcoming stations, and contribute to the country’s progress with every project.</p>
                <p>The main challenge in the upcoming years is going to be the rising demand in railway traffic, increased density in our timetables, thus less time-windows for maintenance work which require the track closings. Those challenges can only be encountered with better planning, and more cooperation between business units based on data in our railway digital twin.</p>

            <h2>What problem did they face?</h2>
            <p>ÖBB-Infrastruktur AG aimed to ensure greater traffic capacity on our tracks while maintaining excellent levels of safety, travel comfort and sustainability. The lifecycle of railway assets needs to be monitored and managed proactively to ensure high availability for railway operation teams. This requires integration of IoT solutions that will confront the challenges related to real-time data processing, secure communication, and predictive analytics. The objective is to enhance mobility, reduce emissions, and optimize maintenance processes.</p>

                <h3>Digital Twin initiative</h3>
                <p>ÖBB-Infrastruktur AG uses a Digital Twin to evaluate current conditions, make predictions, and simulate possible situations. Digital Twin is a digital representation of a physical system, in this case, the railway infrastructure. The approach requires accessing real-time asset condition data as well as time-series records. ThingsBoard acts as one major enabling technology of this initiative, offering a unified platform for IoT data ingestion, processing, visualization, and analysis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>ThingsBoard enables seamless integration of diverse IoT devices deployed via communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP, HTTP) across the rail infrastructure for real-time data collection.</p></li>
                    <li><p>ThingsBoard Edge allows on-premise data processing, keeping critical data within ÖBB’s private network and facilitates secure integration with internal systems without exposing them to the public internet as well as prevent data loss in situations of network separation between cloud and on-premise.</p></li>
                    <li><p>ThingsBoard Cloud provides powerful visualization tools through customizable dashboards, enabling internal stakeholders to monitor assets, track performance, and analyze trends.</p></li>
                    <li><p>ThingsBoard enables condition monitoring and predictive maintenance through the analysis of sensor data and environmental parameters, reducing unplanned downtime by generating alerts based on predefined thresholds and conditions.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Assessing current asset conditions ("What now?") and forecasting future developments ("What next?") based on data processed in the Digital Twin.</p></li>

                <h3>Secure and resilient data flow for ÖBB-Infrastruktur AG</h3>
                <p>ThingsBoard Edge instances, strategically deployed  on-premises within ÖBB-Infrastruktur AG's infrastructure, ensure secure data flow entirely within the internal IT network, avoiding exposure to the public Internet and firewall bridging. By caching IoT data locally until a successful transmission to the ThingsBoard PE instance in the ÖBB Azure Cloud Tenant, this setup achieves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Network Decoupling: Efficiently separates on-premises and cloud environments, reducing dependencies and potential disruptions.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Resilience to Network Issues: Maintains data integrity and operational continuity during Internet slowdowns, VPN issues, or cloud connectivity problems.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Optimized Data Flow: Allows continuous data processing even when Site2Site VPN or ExpressRoute connections experience challenges.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This architecture not only enhances data security and availability but also supports real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance as part of ÖBB's Digital Twin initiative.</p>
