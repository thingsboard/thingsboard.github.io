                <p>The client is IONA Tech, a company that creates technology to reduce the risks of electrostatic discharge (ESD). These risks can damage electronic devices or cause safety problems in factories. Their main product, the StatIQ Band, is a wearable device that measures and alerts users about dangerous ESD levels, helping to protect workers and improve product quality. Their goal is to make workplaces safer and more efficient by using advanced technology and data.</p>
