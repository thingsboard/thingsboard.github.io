                <h3>Challenges in managing a large retail network</h3>
                <p>The Schwarz Group, a global retail leader operating over 13,000 stores in 32 countries, faced significant challenges in managing the huge amount of technical equipment within its supermarket network. Each store utilised a variety of devices and systems from different manufacturers, leading to inconsistencies and complexities in management. Data was scattered across different systems, making it almost impossible to get a clear overview of operations. As the company expanded, integrating new stores and devices into the existing infrastructure became increasingly challenging. These issues slowed down operations, increased costs, and prevented the Schwarz Group from running all its stores in a smooth, standardised way.</p>
