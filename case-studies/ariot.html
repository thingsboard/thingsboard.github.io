            <h2>Ariot IOT Teknolojileri </h2>
            <p class="quote">“At ARIOT, our mission with Medline Adana Hospital was to elevate their operational reliability to match their world-class JCI accreditation. By leveraging the flexibility of ThingsBoard combined with robust LoRaWAN infrastructure, we transformed their critical environmental monitoring from a reactive, manual process into a proactive, data-driven operation. This solution provided immediate value by ensuring 100% data integrity for compliance audits and eliminating the risk of high-value pharmaceutical spoilage through real-time alerting. Ultimately, we didn't just install sensors; we delivered peace of mind and a scalable digital backbone that secures patient safety and optimizes hospital efficiency around the clock."</p>

            <h2>What problem did they face?</h2>
            <p>Prior to adopting the IoT solution, the hospital relied on manual processes that posed significant operational risks. Staff had to manually log temperatures for vaccine fridges, blood banks, and morgue units, creating a risk of human error and data gaps. Furthermore, the hospital’s large concrete structure made traditional wired cabling expensive and invasive.</p>

        <h2>How ThingsBoard powers Medline Adana Hospital</h2>
        <div class="block">
            <div class="text">
                <h3>Centralized critical infrastructure monitoring</h3>
                <p>ARIOT utilized ThingsBoard to create role-based dashboards for different hospital units including the Pharmacy, Laboratory, and Morgue. The Morgue Dashboard provides real-time visibility into the temperature of individual cabinets, replacing manual charts with digital trends. Similarly, the Laboratory Dashboard offers instant status updates on blood banks and depot fridges on a single pane of glass.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Advanced rule engine for real-time alarms</h3>
                <p>The solution leverages ThingsBoard’s Rule Engine to monitor specific thresholds for critical assets. If a TS201 probe inside a vaccine cabinet detects a temperature deviation, or if an EM300-TH sensor in a transformer room detects overheating, the system triggers immediate alerts to the technical team via SMS and Email.</p>

                <h3>Data integrity with "Store and Forward" </h3>
                <p>Data gaps are unacceptable in healthcare. ThingsBoard processes telemetry from Milesight sensors which feature "Data Retransmission." If the hospital network goes down, sensors like the EM300 series store up to 1000+ records internally. Once connectivity is restored, ThingsBoard ingests this historical data to fill the gaps, guaranteeing a complete audit trail.</p>
