                <h3>One platform for all energy devices</h3>
                <p>ThingsBoard makes it much easier for smart energy companies to manage their operations. Instead of juggling different systems for different types of devices, companies can connect everything into one platform. ThingsBoard supports all the major communication protocols - like MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, LwM2M, SNMP, Modbus, and OPC-UA - which means it can easily work with a wide range of energy devices without any extra hassle.</p>
