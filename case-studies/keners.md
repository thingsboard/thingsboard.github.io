            <p>“We started using the Thingsboard (TB) in 2017, and later switched to the professional edition (PE). We are very satisfied with the platform as it provides us with high flexibility and stability. We highly appreciate the visual editor for Rule engine new Multitenancy approach. The platform provides for us a unique possibility to create our own data connectors, which allows us to create dashboards and combine data from multiple data sources. <br><br> We highly appreciate the support of the creators, their feedback is simply excellent!”</p>

                <h3>Scaling AgriTech with stability and support</h3>
                <p>Keners s.r.o. began using ThingsBoard in 2017 and later transitioned to the Professional Edition to meet their growing needs. The platform offered the flexibility and stability they required to develop solutions for agriculture and environmental monitoring. With the visual Rule Engine editor, their team was able to configure data processing flows efficiently. The multitenancy capabilities allowed them to manage different clients and use cases independently. ThingsBoard also enabled them to create custom data connectors, which made it possible to integrate multiple data sources and display them through intuitive dashboards. Throughout the process, Keners greatly appreciated the responsiveness and support of the ThingsBoard team, which they described as excellent.</p>

                <h3>Digital transformation for smarter farming</h3>
                <p>ThingsBoard empowers agricultural businesses to transition from manual processes to data-driven, automated operations. The platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools that enable real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and smart automation across farms, greenhouses, storage facilities, and field equipment. One of the most powerful features of ThingsBoard is its interactive dashboards, which allow users to visualise live and historical data from soil sensors, weather stations, machinery, and other connected devices. These dashboards can be customised using an extensive widget library and built with dynamic layouts to create intuitive, responsive interfaces for different user roles and devices.</p>

                <h3>Automating agriculture with Rule Engine 2.0</h3>
                <p>The Rule Engine 2.0 plays a central role in enabling smart automation. It allows users to create low-code workflows that react to incoming data in real time. For example, irrigation systems can automatically activate based on soil moisture thresholds, or alerts can be triggered when storage temperatures exceed safe ranges. These workflows use a visual editor, making them accessible even to non-developers.</p>
