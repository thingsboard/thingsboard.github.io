        <p>
            When we started with ThingsBoard we mainly used it for core messaging and the dashboard functionality. 
            Large parts of the business logic was done by an external backend connecting to ThingsBoard using the API. 
            Within the first two releases of the new Rule Engine, we were able to migrate basically everything to the platform. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to congratulate the team for the huge effort they have put into the solution.
            The concept of the rule engine and the available nodes are very well thought through and support a wide range of applications. 
            And - probably most important - Andrew and his team listens closely to the needs and requirements of their customers. 
            And you clearly see that in the product. We can commend this product to anybody looking for a flexible and stable IoT Solution and are looking forward to work with the team in the future.

            Our company operates with the Smart Building Technology sector and were looking for a solution that was adaptable, programmable and easy to use for providing complete solutions to our existing customers with good clear visualisations of their data. 
            We had researched and tried other solutions but no other could match this platform in terms of its capability.
            Once learning the basics, we could quickly deploy and add customers sites without the need for continual support. 
        </p>
        <p>
            What we especially like from the Thingsboard team are the updates and continual evolving development cycles, real people you can talk to and understand ideas, concepts and future use cases. 
            Features to the system are being updated and new functionality added where, in the modern age of new technology, is essential to offer new services when they occur. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The support levels received from initial contact to ongoing projects has been excellent from the entire team and we look forward to expanding our future solutions to all customers with the support from the Thingsboard team. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you haven’t tried this solution we 100% recommend it to anyone interested in emerging IOT platforms and what the value collected data can truly bring.
