            Canadian LoRaWAN™ network operator and IoT integrator.

        <p>
            We were looking for a robust and scalable IoT platform to help us deploy leading edge LoRaWAN™-based IoT projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            We landed a contract to deploy a city-wide network of solar/wireless variable message “No Parking” signs to manage on-street parking for snow removal operations. The deadline to develop, test and deploy the overall solution was very tight and included penalties for late delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
            ThingsBoard engineers worked hand in hand with our developers to develop the MQTT-based communication protocol between the X-TELIA network and ThingsBoard, developed a beautiful custom widget for controlling the no parking signs, implemented our instance of ThingsBoard PE and provided incredible support to make sure we made it to the finish line on time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can say that the dedication of ThingsBoard team blew me away. I look forward to building and deploying many new and exciting projects on ThingsBoard, as I know the team backing the platform is second to none in expertise and dedication.

            During our evaluation of several different IoT platforms we decided using ThingsBoard Community Edition to quickly get started with testing of our concept solutions. Since it offers an easy way to get access to data from all our sensors and supports building dashboards for visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, we soon discovered that ThingsBoard also fulfilled our need to build commercial services. With increasing number of sensors, customers and requirements we have migrated to ThingsBoard Professional Edition with a lot more functionality for larger deployments and multiple customers. And we will add additional servers as our customers grow.

            While building the Smart City solution for OMS, a. s. we were looking for IoT platform serving as core backend for our solutions. ThingsBoard became our first clear choice. It contains necessary business functionality and support all needed technologies/protocols which we required. Later on, ThingsBoard became the heart of the upcoming solution. In any implementation of complex systems cooperation and support are crucial to success achievement. We are glad that we found stable partners in design, implementation and deployment of ThingsBoard in the Smart City solution.
