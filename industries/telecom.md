            TEKTELIC is a leading supplier of LoRaWAN IoT equipment including best-in-class gateways and end

        <p>
        We engaged ThingsBoard to complete our end-to-end solution and to address several of our
        clients’ LoRaWAN IoT applications and Proof-of-Concept trials. Working with ThingsBoard we were able
        to dramatically reduce time to market, de-risk our technology investment and delight our customers by
        delivering a complete, high-quality applications which exceeded ours and our client’s expectations.
        </p> 
        <p>
        The ThingsBoard team is made up of highly skilled engineers who have solid experience in building
        complex systems. In our case the ThingsBoard team had to incorporate and render data from a number
        our multifunction sensors, including our Industrial and All-in- One Home sensors to create an integrated,
        user friendly and visually appealing application. The application had to provide triggers and alarms,
        real-time and historical data visualization and the ability to send control commands to the end devices.
        Moreover, it also had to be seamlessly integrated with our Network Server. Despite these varied and
        complicated requirements, the ThingsBoard team developed the application on budget and in a very
        short time.
        </p> 
        <p>
        The ThingsBoard team is responsive, easy to work with and extremely professional. They have been a
        great partner in the development of our end-to- end IoT solution. We highly recommend them for
        addressing your complete IoT applications requirements in a cost effective and timely manner.

        <p>
        We were looking for a robust and scalable IoT platform to help us deploy leading edge LoRaWAN™-based IoT projects.
        </p> 
        <p>
        We landed a contract to deploy a city-wide network of solar/wireless variable message “No Parking” signs to manage on-street parking for snow removal operations.  The deadline to develop, test and deploy the overall solution was very tight and included penalties for late delivery.
        </p> 
        <p>
        ThingsBoard engineers worked hand in hand with our developers to develop the MQTT-based communication protocol between the X-TELIA network and ThingsBoard, developed a beautiful custom widget for controlling the no parking signs, implemented our instance of ThingsBoard PE and provided incredible support to make sure we made it to the finish line on time.
        </p> 
        <p>
        I can say that the dedication of ThingsBoard team blew me away. I look forward to building and deploying many new and exciting projects on ThingsBoard, as I know the team backing the platform is second to none in expertise and dedication.
