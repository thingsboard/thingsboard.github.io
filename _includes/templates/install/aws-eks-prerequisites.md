### Install and configure tools 

To deploy ThingsBoard on EKS cluster you'll need to install [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), 
 [`eksctl`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html) and 
 [`awscli`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) tools.

Afterwards you need to configure Access Key, Secret Key and default region. 
To get Access and Secret keys please follow [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) guide.
The default region should be the ID of the region where you'd like to deploy the cluster.

```
aws configure
```
