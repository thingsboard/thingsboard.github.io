 - **Advanced configuration**

See configuration yml file below for a list of possible configuration parameters, corresponding environment variables and their default values.
For example, default client id of the integration, that is used in integration debug messages is *"remote"* and can be altered by setting *"RPC_CLIENT_ID"* environment variable.
