#### RabbitMQ Installation

For installing RabbitMQ use this [instruction](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-windows.html).

Create docker compose file for ThingsBoard queue service:

Add the following line to the yml file. Don't forget to replace "YOUR_USERNAME" and "YOUR_PASSWORD" with your **real user credentials**, "localhost" and "5672" with your **real RabbitMQ host and port**:

```yml

services:
  mytb:
    restart: always

    ports:
      - "8080:9090"
