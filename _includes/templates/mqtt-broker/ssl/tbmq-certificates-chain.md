#### Step 1. Prepare your server and client certificate chain

Follow the [MQTT over SSL](/docs/mqtt-broker/security/mqtts/) guide to provision server certificate if you are hosting your own TBMQ instance.

Once provisioned, you should prepare a CA root certificate in pem format. This certificate will be used by MQTT clients to validate the server certificate.
Save the CA root certificate to your working directory as "**ca.pem**".

#### Step 2. Generate Client certificate chain

We should generate a certificate chain with **reasonable** Common Names (CNs). We will use the intermediate certificate to sign certificates for our devices.
For example, the certificate chain CNs might be the following: 

 * Root certificate CN: company-name.com;
 * Intermediate certificate: device-group-name.company-name.com;
 * Device certificate: device-name.device-group-name.company-name.com;

Use the following commands to generate the self-signed private keys, certificate signing requests, and x509 certificates
for each chain level. The commands are based on the **OpenSSL** tool, which is most likely already installed on your workstation:

**Step 2.1** Generate root certificate 

Generate the Root certificate and private key, use the following command. Don't forget to put the correct CN when prompted:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout rootKey.pem -out rootCert.pem -sha256 -days 365 -nodes
```

To generate the intermediate key and certificate request, use the following command. Don't forget to put the correct CN when prompted:

To generate the intermediate certificate, use the following command.

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in intermediate.csr -out intermediateCert.pem -CA rootCert.pem -CAkey rootKey.pem -days 365 -sha256 -CAcreateserial -extfile <(echo "basicConstraints=CA:TRUE,pathlen:0")

To generate the device key and certificate request, use the following command. Don't forget to put the correct CN when prompted:

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout deviceKey.pem -out device.csr -sha256 -nodes
```

```

Finally, you need to concatenate certificates into a chain starting from the device certificate till the root.

```bash
cat deviceCert.pem intermediateCert.pem rootCert.pem > chain.pem
```
{: .copy-code}

The output of the commands will be private keys and certificates for each level of chain. In the next steps
we will use device key file *deviceKey.pem* and a chain of certificates *chain.pem*.

#### Step 3. Provision Intermediate Public Key in MQTT Client Credentials

Go to **TBMQ Web UI -> Authentication -> Credentials -> Create new or update exising one**.
Select **X.509 Certificate Chain** type, insert the CN of *intermediateCert.pem* file.

#### Step 4. Trust the certificate

For the MQTT client to establish a secure TLS connection, the CA (Certificate Authority) that signed its certificate must be trusted.
If the certificate is issued by a well-known public CA, it is already trusted by default.
If both TBMQ and the clients use certificates issued by the same CA, no additional configuration is required.
If it is another private or internal CA, you must add the CA certificate (`rootCert.pem`) to the Java truststore used by TBMQ.

Run the [following command](/docs/mqtt-broker/security/mqtts/#adding-certificate-into-java-truststore) to import the CA certificate into the truststore.

#### Step 5. Test the connection

Execute the following command to upload temperature readings to TBMQ using secure channel:

```bash
mosquitto_pub --cafile ca.pem -d -q 1 -h "YOUR_TBMQ_HOST" -p "8883" \
-t "sensors/temperature" --key deviceKey.pem --cert chain.pem -m {"temperature":25}
```
{: .copy-code}

Similar command for the [self-signed](/docs/mqtt-broker/security/mqtts/#self-signed-certificates-generation) server certificate:

```bash
mosquitto_pub --insecure --cafile server.pem -d -q 1 -h "YOUR_TBMQ_HOST" -p "8883" \
-t "sensors/temperature" --key deviceKey.pem --cert chain.pem -m {"temperature":25}
```
{: .copy-code}

Don't forget to replace **YOUR_TBMQ_HOST** with the host of your TBMQ instance.
