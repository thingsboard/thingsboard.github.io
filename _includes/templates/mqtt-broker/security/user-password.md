If a user signs in using [OAuth 2.0](/docs/pe/mqtt-broker/security/oauth-2-support/#basic-mapper) while the **Allow user creation** option is enabled, the user account is automatically created in the system.
These users are created without a password set and can continue using Single Sign-On (SSO) to log in.
If the user wants to log in using a regular username/password flow, they should go to **Account → Security** and [set a new password](/docs/pe/mqtt-broker/user-guide/ui/settings/#change-password).
When changing the password, leave the **Current password** field empty.
