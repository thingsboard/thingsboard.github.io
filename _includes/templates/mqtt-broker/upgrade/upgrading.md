Review the [release notes](/docs/mqtt-broker/releases/) and [upgrade instruction](/docs/mqtt-broker/install/upgrade-instructions/)
for detailed information on the latest changes.

If there are no **Upgrade to x.x.x** notes for your version, you can proceed directly with the general [upgrade instructions](#run-upgrade).

If the documentation does not cover the specific upgrade instructions for your case, 
please [contact us](/docs/mqtt-broker/help/) so we can provide further guidance.
