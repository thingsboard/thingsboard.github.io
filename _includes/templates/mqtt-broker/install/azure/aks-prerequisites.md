### Install and configure tools

To deploy TBMQ on the AKS cluster, you will need to install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/),
[helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), and [az](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) tools.

After installation is done, you need to log in to the cli using the next command:

```bash
az login
```
{: .copy-code}
