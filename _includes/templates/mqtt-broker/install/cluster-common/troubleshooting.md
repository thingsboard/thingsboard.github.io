In case of any issues you can examine service logs for errors. For example to see TBMQ logs execute the following command:

```bash
kubectl logs -f tb-broker-0
```
{: .copy-code}

Use the next command to see the state of all statefulsets.
```bash
kubectl get statefulsets
```
{: .copy-code}

See [kubectl Cheat Sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) command reference for more details.
