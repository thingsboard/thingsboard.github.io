Now youâ€™re ready to install TBMQ using the Helm chart.
Make sure you're in the same directory as your customized `values.yaml` file.

```bash
helm install my-tbmq-cluster tbmq-helm-chart/tbmq-cluster \
  -f values.yaml \
  --set installation.installDbSchema=true
```
{: .copy-code}

{% capture installation-tip %}

`my-tbmq-cluster` is the Helm release name. You can change it to any name of your choice, which will be used to reference this deployment in future Helm commands.

{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=installation-tip %}
