To deploy TBMQ Cluster using Helm on EKS cluster, you need to have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [eksctl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html)
- [awscli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

Afterward, you need to configure Access Key, Secret Key and default region.
To get Access and Secret keys, please follow [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) guide.
The default region should be the ID of the region where you'd like to deploy the cluster.
