The process of configuring the load balancer using Google-managed SSL certificates is described on the official [documentation page](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/managed-certs).
The instructions below are extracted from the official documentation. Make sure you read [prerequisites](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/managed-certs#prerequisites) carefully before proceeding.

```bash
gcloud compute addresses create {{staticIP}} --global
```
{: .copy-code}

Replace the *PUT_YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE* with valid domain name in the *https-load-balancer.yml* file:

```bash
nano receipts/https-load-balancer.yml
```
{: .copy-code}

Execute the following command to deploy secure http load balancer:

```bash
 kubectl apply -f receipts/https-load-balancer.yml
```
{: .copy-code}

The process of load balancer provisioning may take some time. You may periodically check the status of the load balancer using the following command:

```bash
kubectl get ingress
```
{: .copy-code}

Once provisioned, you should see similar output:

```text
NAME                           CLASS    HOSTS   ADDRESS         PORTS   AGE
tb-broker-https-loadbalancer   gce      *       34.111.24.134   80      7m25s
```

Now, **assign the domain name** you have used to the load balancer IP address (the one you see instead of 34.111.24.134 in the command output).

Check that the domain name is configured correctly using dig:

```bash
dig YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME
```
{: .copy-code}

Sample output:

```text

```

Once assigned, wait for the Google-managed certificate to finish provisioning. This might take up to 60 minutes. You can check the status of the certificate using the following command:

```bash
kubectl describe managedcertificate managed-cert
```
{: .copy-code}

Certificate will be eventually provisioned if you have configured domain records properly.
