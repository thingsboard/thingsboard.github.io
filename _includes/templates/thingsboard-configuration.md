## Thingsboard configuration

**Note** Thingsboard configuration steps are necessary only in case of **local Thingsboard installation**.
If you are using [Live Demo](http://demo.thingsboard.io/) instance all entities are pre-configured for your demo account.
However, we recommend to review this steps because you will still need to get device access token to send requests to Thingsboard.
