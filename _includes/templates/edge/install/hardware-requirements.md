#### Edge Hardware Requirements

The hardware requirements for ThingsBoard Edge depend on the number of devices connected to the edge and the extent of GUI usage locally.

If you're planning to run ThingsBoard Edge **without** heavy GUI usage (local dashboards, device management, etc.), and you have a relatively small number of devices (under 100) connected to a single machine, then a minimum of 1GB of RAM should suffice.

On the other hand, if you anticipate heavy GUI usage (local dashboards, device management, etc.) and you're connecting 100+ devices on a single machine, we recommend having at least 4GB of RAM to ensure optimal performance.
