### Edge Hardware Requirements

The hardware requirements for **ThingsBoard Edge** are determined by the number of connected devices and the intensity of interactions with the platform interface.
To ensure optimal performance, we recommend the following:
* **At least 1GB of RAM (Light workload):** It is suitable for minimal interactions with the platform interface, such as dashboards and device management, and fewer than 100 connected devices.
* **At least 4GB of RAM (Heavy workload):** This configuration is suitable for intense platform interactions and 100+ devices connected to a single machine.
