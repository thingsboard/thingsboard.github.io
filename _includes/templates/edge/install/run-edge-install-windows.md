Launch windows shell (Command Prompt) as Administrator. Change directory to your ThingsBoard Edge installation directory.

Execute **install.bat** script to install ThingsBoard Edge as a Windows service.
This means it will be automatically started on system startup. 
Similar, **uninstall.bat** will remove ThingsBoard Edge from Windows services.

  ```text
