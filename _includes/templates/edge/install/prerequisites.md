#### Prerequisites
##### ThingsBoard Cloud server 
To start using ThingsBoard **Edge** you need to have ThingsBoard CE/PE server that supports edge functionality up and running. 

The easiest way is to use [**ThingsBoard Cloud**](https://thingsboard.cloud/signup) server or [Live Demo](https://demo.thingsboard.io/signup) server.

The alternative option is to install ThingsBoard Professional or Community Edition server that supports edge functionality on-premise.
Please visit [Install PE](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/installation-options/) or [Install CE](/docs/user-guide/install/installation-options/) to install **3.3** version or higher of server that supports edge functionality.

##### Edge provision on cloud
Additionally, you will need to provision ThingsBoard **Edge** on cloud server. Please visit this guide [Provision edge on CE server](/docs/edge/provision-edge-on-server-ce/) or [Provision edge on PE server](/docs/edge/provision-edge-on-server-pe/) respectively.

Once ThingsBoard **Edge** provisioned on cloud server please follow installation steps below.
