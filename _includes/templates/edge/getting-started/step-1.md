For simplicity, we will provision device manually using the UI.

We are going to provision device on the Edge. Please open ThingsBoard **Edge** UI using the URL **http://EDGE_URL**.

You may also use:
* [Bulk provisioning](/docs/user-guide/bulk-provisioning/) to provision multiple devices from a CSV file using UI;
* [REST API](/docs/api/) to provision devices and other entities programmatically;
