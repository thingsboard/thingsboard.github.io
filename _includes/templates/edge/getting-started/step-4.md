Any real-world assets, devices, sensors or other logical components are represented within **ThingsBoard** as corresponding [entities](/docs/{{peDocsPrefix}}user-guide/entities-and-relations/){: target="_blank"}.

To view the published entity (e.g., device), log in to the **{{currentThingsBoardVersion}}** at **SERVER_URL**:
