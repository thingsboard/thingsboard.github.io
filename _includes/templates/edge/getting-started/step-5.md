The **entities** can also be created on the **Server** and then assigned to the **Edge instance**. 
This approach simplifies the management of entities across multiple **Edge instances**.

To assign entities to the **Edge**, log in to your **{{currentThingsBoardVersion}} Server** at **SERVER_URL** and create an **entity**, for example, a dashboard. 

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step5Server" showListImageTitles="true" %}

To confirm that assigned entity is available on the **Edge**, open the **EDGE_URL** and go to the corresponding entity section:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step5Edge" showListImageTitles="true" %}
