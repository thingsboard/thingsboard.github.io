A **Dashboard** is another key entity within **ThingsBoard**. It allows you to visualize IoT data and control devices through the user interface.

To create a **dashboard**, login to your **ThingsBoard Edge** instance and navigate to the **Dashboard** section. Then, follow these steps:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step2-1" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Once the **dashboard** is created, the system will automatically redirect you to the **Edit mode** page. 
To add a **widget**, select one from the **widget library**, where widgets are grouped into bundles. 
Each widget is linked to a data source, which defines the data it will display. 

For example, let's add and configure the **Entities table** and **Time series chart** widgets:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step2-2" showListImageTitles="true" %}
