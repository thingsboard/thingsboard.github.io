##### ThingsBoard Cloud server 

To start using ThingsBoard **Edge** you need to have {{currentThingsBoardVersion}} server that supports edge functionality up and running. 

{% if currentThingsBoardVersion == "ThingsBoard Professional Edition" %}
Please visit [Install PE](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/installation-options/) to install **3.3** version or higher of server that supports edge functionality.

At the moment [**ThingsBoard Cloud**](https://thingsboard.cloud/signup) doesn't support edge functionality. This will be available in **October 2021**.
{% endif %}
{% if currentThingsBoardVersion == "ThingsBoard Community Edition" %}
The easiest way is to use [Live Demo](https://demo.thingsboard.io/signup) server.
The alternative option is to install ThingsBoard Community Edition server that supports edge functionality on-premise.
Please visit [Install CE](/docs/user-guide/install/installation-options/) to install **3.3** version or higher of server that supports edge functionality.
