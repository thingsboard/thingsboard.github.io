You can use ThingsBoard Edge software based on a license subscription. 
We assume you have already chosen your subscription plan or decided to purchase a perpetual license. 
If not, please navigate to [pricing](/pricing/?active=thingsboard-edge) page to select the best license option for your case and get your license. 
See [How-to get pay-as-you-go subscription](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK-QDFGxWek){:target="_blank"} or [How-to get perpetual license](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPe0lHolWek){:target="_blank"} for more details.

Once you get the license secret, please put it to a safe place. We will use it for ThingsBoard Edge provisioning in the next steps.
