To establish a connection with ThingsBoard Edge, you first need to create an <strong>Edge entity</strong> on the ThingsBoard server.

#### Create edge entity

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="addEdge" showListImageTitles="true" %}

#### Copy Edge credentials

After the Edge entity has been created, the **Edge Key** and **Edge Secret** will be auto-generated for this edge. You'll use these credentials to link the edge with the cloud.
