Also we will create a dashboard that displays how many miles has been traveled and how many are left to change the oil in the vehicle.

Please open ThingsBoard **{{currentThingsBoardVersion}}** to create a new dashboard:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="createDashboard" showListImageTitles="true" %}

**Congratulations!** You have successfully sent from the device telemetry, saved it on the edge, pushed to the cloud filtered data and visualized it on the dashboard.
