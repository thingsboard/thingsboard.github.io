ThingsBoard is able to use SQL or NoSQL(Cassandra) database layer. 
You can configure your platform to use either scalable Cassandra DB cluster or various SQL databases. 
If you prefer to use an SQL database, we recommend PostgreSQL. 

By default, ThingsBoard uses embedded **HSQLDB** instance which is very convenient for running tests and development 
but **IS NOT RECOMMENDED** for any evaluation or production environments.
