ThingsBoard is able to use SQL or NoSQL(Cassandra) database layer. 
By default, ThingsBoard uses embedded HSQLDB instance which is very convenient for evaluation or development purposes. 

If this is your first experience with ThingsBoard we recommend to **skip this step** and use embedded database.   
Alternatively, you can configure your platform to use either scalable Cassandra DB cluster or various SQL databases. 
If you prefer to use an SQL database, we recommend PostgreSQL.
