The widget subscribes to the reminder alarm status field of the device profile it uses. This allows it to receive updates about alarm creation, its type, and severity.

If an alarm rule is executed, the propeller will change its color based on the widget settings and the alarm severity type defined in the device profile.   
For example, if the heat pump widget detects an alarm with a severity type of "Major", "Minor", "Warning" or "Indeterminate", the widget will switch to the "Warning" state, and the propeller will change its color to yellow.
If the alarm severity level is "Critical," the widget will switch to the "Critical" state, and the propeller will change its color to red and start flashing.
