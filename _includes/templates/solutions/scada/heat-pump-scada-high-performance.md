The widget subscribes to the reminder alarm status field of the device profile it uses. This allows it to receive updates about alarm creation, its type, and severity.

If an alarm rule is executed, a warning icon appears in the bottom left corner of the heat pump.
The type of the icon depends on the severity of the alarm, the rules of which are defined in the device profile, as well as the settings of the widget itself.   
For example, if a heat pump widget encounters an alarm with a severity type of "Major", "Minor", "Warning", or "Indeterminate", the widget will be in a "Warning" state, and a yellow triangle will appear next to the widget.
If the alarm severity level is "Critical", the widget will be in a "Critical" state, and a red square will appear next to the widget.
