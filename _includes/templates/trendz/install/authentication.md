You can access Trendz UI by default at http://localhost:8888

For first authentication, you need to use **Tenant Administrator** credentials from your **ThingsBoard**.

Trendz uses ThingsBoard as an authentication service. During first sign in ThingsBoard service should be also available
to validate credentials.

After the first login to Trendz, you need to discover topology to allow Trendz to know about assets, devices, their profiles and relations.
You could read more about how Trendz uses this topology [here](/docs/trendz/business-entities).
