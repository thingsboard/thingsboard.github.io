RPC To Connector allows you to send a command to the connector from the ThingsBoard IoT Gateway UI.
It is important to note that the method you are calling must be defined on the OPC-UA server.

{% capture difference %}
**Please note**: The RPC To Connector will execute the method on every device that has the OPC-UA connector configured.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=difference %}

As an example, we will use ThingsBoard OPC-UA Demo Server, which can be run using Docker and the following command:
```bash
docker run -it -p 4840:4840 thingsboard/tb-gw-opcua-server:latest
```

The server has the following endpoint URL: `opc.tcp://0.0.0.0:4840/freeopcua/server/`.

#### Example: Relay Controlling

Let's see a practical example of using RPC To Connector. On our OPC-UA server, we have "set_relay" method that
turns on or off the relay. The method accepts a boolean argument, where `true` turns on the relay and `false` turns 
it off. To call this method, use the following steps:

{% assign rpcToConnector = '

        image: /images/gateway/opc-ua-connector/examples/rpc-to-connector-1.png,
        title: Select the created OPC-UA connector, click on the "**RPC**" icon. Make sure you have configured and connected device (if you do not know how to do it, see [Getting Started](/docs/iot-gateway/getting-started/?connectorsCreation=opcua){:target="_blank"} guide or [Connection settings](/docs/iot-gateway/config/opc-ua/#connection-settings) and [Data mapping](/docs/iot-gateway/config/opc-ua/#data-mapping) sections of this guide).

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=rpcToConnector %}

Let's first turn on the relay. To do this, fill in the "**Method**" field with `set_relay` and in the "**Arguments**" field
enter `true`, then click on the "**Send**" button.

As you can see, the response contains `true`, which means that the method was executed successfully and the relay is 
now on:

And finally, let's turn off the relay. To do this, fill in the "**Method**" field with `set_relay` and in the
"**Arguments**" field enter `false`, then click on the "**Send**" button:

Result:

Full configuration for OPC-UA connector for the example above will look like this:

```json
