Every telemetry and attribute parameter has `GET` and `SET` RPC methods out of the box, so you donâ€™t need to configure 
them manually.

As an example, we will use Prosys OPC-UA Simulation Server, which is 
available at `opc.tcp://0.0.0.0:53530/OPCUA/SimulationServer`. The server has the following structure:

We are interested in node "**Relay**" that have `ns=3;i=1012` identifier, we added this node as a telemetry parameter 
with the key `relay` and as a path we used the node identifier `${ns=3;i=1012}`, so the configuration for this 
telemetry will look like this:

```json
"timeseries": [
  {
    "key": "relay",
    "path": "${ns=3;i=1012}"
  }
]
```

Let's check the value of the relay node using the reserved `get` method. To get the current value of relay node, 
run the query in RPC debug terminal:

```bash
get ns=3;i=1012;
```

Response:

```json
{"result":  {"value":  false}}
```

So, the `get` method returns the current value of the relay node, and we can see that the relay is off.

The RPC Debug Terminal is used only for example purpose, so you can use any other widget that supports RPC calls.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=difference %}

To set the value of the relay node and turn it on, run the query:

```bash
set ns=3;i=1012; true
```

Response:

```json
{"result":  {"value":  true}}
```

And as you can see, from the screenshot below, the relay telemetry value has changed to `true`:

Also, let's check the value of the relay telemetry again:

```bash
get ns=3;i=1012;
```

Response:

```json
{"result":  {"value":  true}}
```

Full configuration for OPC-UA connector for the examples above will look like this:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "url": "opc.tcp://0.0.0.0:53530/OPCUA/SimulationServer",
    "timeoutInMillis": 5000,
    "scanPeriodInMillis": 3600000,
    "enableSubscriptions": true,
    "subCheckPeriodInMillis": 100,
    "showMap": false,
    "security": "Basic128Rsa15",
    "identity": {
      "type": "anonymous"
    },
    "pollPeriodInMillis": 5000
  },
  "mapping": [
    {
      "deviceNodePattern": "Root\\.Objects\\.DemoDevice",
      "deviceNodeSource": "path",
      "deviceInfo": {
        "deviceNameExpression": "Demo Device",
        "deviceNameExpressionSource": "constant",
        "deviceProfileExpression": "default",
        "deviceProfileExpressionSource": "constant"
      },
      "attributes": [],
      "attributes_updates": [],
      "timeseries": [
        {
          "key": "relay",
          "type": "identifier",
          "value": "${ns=3;i=1012}"
        }
      ],
      "rpc_methods": []
    }
  ]
}
```
