RPC to Device allows you to execute an OPC-UA server method on a specific device.
It is important to note that the method you are calling must be defined on the OPC-UA server.

As an example, we will use ThingsBoard OPC-UA Demo Server, which can be run using Docker and the following command:
```bash
docker run -it -p 4840:4840 thingsboard/tb-gw-opcua-server:latest
```

The server has the following endpoint URL: `opc.tcp://0.0.0.0:4840/freeopcua/server/`.

#### Example: Multiplying Numbers

We are interested in "**multiply**" method node which will multiply two numbers that we will pass as arguments.
To call this method, first we need to configure the OPC-UA connector to support RPC calls. For this purpose, follow 
these steps:

{% assign rpcToDevice = '

        title: Select the created OPC-UA connector, click on the "**Data mapping**" tab. Make sure you have configured and connected device (if you do not know how to do it, see [Getting Started](/docs/iot-gateway/getting-started/?connectorsCreation=opcua){:target="_blank"} guide or [Connection settings](/docs/iot-gateway/config/opc-ua/#connection-settings) and [Data mapping](/docs/iot-gateway/config/opc-ua/#data-mapping) sections of this guide). Click on the "**Pencil**" icon on a device you want to configure RPC method for.

    ===
        image: /images/gateway/opc-ua-connector/examples/rpc-to-device-2.png,
        title: Click on the "Add method" button. In our case, we will add the `multiply` method, so fill in the "**Method**" field with `multiply` and in the "**Arguments**" field, enter the arguments that the method accepts, in our case it is two numbers, feel free to enter any numbers.

We are done with configuration, so let's check how to call the method. In the RPC Debug Terminal widget, run the 
following command:

```bash
multiply
```

In this case, the method will be called with the arguments that we specified in the configuration (default arguments). 
As you remember, in our case, we enter 5 and 4, so the result is:

Also, we can pass arguments to the method directly from the RPC Debug Terminal widget using the following command:

```bash
multiply [3,4]
```

Response:

Full configuration for OPC-UA connector for the example above will look like this:

```json
