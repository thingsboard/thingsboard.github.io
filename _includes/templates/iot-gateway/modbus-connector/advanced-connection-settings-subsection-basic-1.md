You can configure additional settings like: TLS connection, polling time, byte order and word order, and other. 
The table below describes the parameters for this purpose:

| **Parameter**                   | **Default value** | **Description**                                                               |
|:--------------------------------|:------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Connection timeout (s)          | **35**            | Timeout in seconds for connecting to Modbus server                            |
| Byte order                      | **LITTLE**        | Order of bytes to read                                                        |
| Word order                      | **LITTLE**        | The order of words when reading several registers                             |
| Retries                         | **true**          | Retrying sending data to the master. The values can be either: true or false  |
| Retries on empty                | **true**          | Retrying sending data to the master if it is empty                            |
| Retries on invalid              | **true**          | Retrying sending data to the master if it is failed                           |
| Poll period (ms)                | **5000**          | Period in milliseconds to check the attributes and the telemetry on the slave |
| Connect attempt time (ms)       | **5000**          | A waiting period in milliseconds before connecting to the master              |
| Connect attempt count           | **5**             | The number of connection attempts made through the ThingsBoard gateway        |
| Wait after failed attempts (ms) | **300000**        | A waiting period in milliseconds before trying to send data to the master     |
| ---                             |                   |                                                                               |

Also, you can configure TLS connection (**can be used only for TCP/UDP connection type**). The table below describes the 
parameters required to configure TLS connection:

| **Parameter**                   | **Description**                                             |
|:--------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| Path to client certificate file | Path to certificate file in filesystem with gateway         |
| Path to private key file        | Path to private key file                                    | 
| Password                        | Server password                                             |
| Server hostname                 | Server hostname (Should match with hostname in certificate) |
| ---                             |                                                             |
