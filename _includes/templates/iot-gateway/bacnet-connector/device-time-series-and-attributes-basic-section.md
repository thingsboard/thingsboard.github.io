Configuration in this subsection provides settings for processing data from BACnet device as timeseries and 
attributes on the platform instance.

To add new time series or attribute key, follow these steps:

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=creatingAttrAndTimeseries %}

For each time series or attribute, you can enable specific report strategy. This strategy defines how often the 
data will be sent to the ThingsBoard server. The following strategies are available:

- **On report period** - sends data to ThingsBoard after the report period;
- **On value change** - sends data to ThingsBoard when the value changes;
- **On value change and report period** - sends data to ThingsBoard when the value changes or after the report period;
- **On received** - sends data to ThingsBoard after receiving data from the device (default strategy).
