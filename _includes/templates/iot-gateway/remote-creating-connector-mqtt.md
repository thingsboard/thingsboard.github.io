Let's add an **MQTT connector**, which will subscribe to some data topics using the 
demo broker with a built-in data generator and send data to the gateway.

### Setup demo MQTT broker

As a demo MQTT broker, we will use docker image, that can be installed and run using the following command:

```shell
docker run -it -p 1884:1884 thingsboard/tb-gw-mqtt-broker:latest
```
{:.copy-code}

After running docker image, you can see the following logs in your terminal:

![](/images/gateway/dashboard/run-demo-mqtt-broker-image.png)

### Setup connector

MQTT connector will establish a connection to a broker named **“Demo Broker”** at **“host.docker.internal”** on port **1884**, using an anonymous security type. 
It will include a data mapping for the **“data/”** topic, specifying a JSON converter and defining attribute and time series mappings for device data. 
Additionally, it will handle connect and disconnect requests for sensors with expressions to extract device names from topic filters.

To create a connector, follow these steps:

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=addNewConnector %} 

First, we need to configure the connection to the demo broker. Let’s start from the "**Connection to broker**" section. 
This section offers detailed connection configuration options and contains several important fields, including host, port, MQTT version, client ID, and security settings. 
The **host** field specifies the address of the broker, while the **port** field indicates the communication port. The **MQTT version** field ensures compatibility with the protocol version being used. The **client ID** uniquely identifies the client, and the **security** settings provides configuration for client authorization at MQTT Broker.

Fill in the following fields with values:

| **Field name** | **Value**            |
|:---------------|:---------------------|
| Host           | host.docker.internal |
| Port           | 1884                 |
| MQTT version   | 5                    |
| Client ID      | randomly generated   |
| Security       | Anonymous            |

"**Requests mapping**" section of the configuration outlines an array that includes all the supported requests for both the gateway and ThingsBoard:
- connect requests;

But for now, we need only connect and disconnect requests. Let's configure requests map using the following steps:
- Click on "**Add mapping**" button;
- In the opened window, select "**Connect request**" in the "**Request type**" dropdown field, fill in "**Topic filter**" with "**sensor/connect**" value. For "**Device**" subsection use the following options/values:

- Click on "**Save**" button.

Following the steps outlined, your gateway will receive and apply the new configuration. 
It will then synchronize its state with the remote server. You can view the synchronization status of the connector configuration in the "**Configuration**" column, which will indicate whether the gateway is successfully aligned with the remote settings.

Also, you can see the connector logs to make sure that the connector works, for this purpose, follow these steps:
{% assign seeConnectorLogs = '

%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=seeConnectorLogs %}

For now, the gateway is ready to process data through the newly created and configured MQTT connector.

Let's publish data to the MQTT Broker defined in the configuration above, you can follow these steps using a tool like 
**mosquitto_pub** or an MQTT client library in your preferred programming language. In this example, we'll use the 
**mosquitto_pub** command-line tool.

1.Ensure that the Mosquitto MQTT clients are installed on your system. Typically, you can install them using the 
package manager of your operating system:
- For Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients
  ```
  {:.copy-code}

- For Windows:

    Download the Mosquitto client tools from [the official website](https://mosquitto.org/download/).

    Install the tools, ensuring that the installation directory is added to the system's PATH.
- For MacOS:
  ```bash
  brew install mosquitto
  ```
  {:.copy-code}

2.Use the mosquitto_pub command to publish data to a specific MQTT topic. In this case, we'll use the "data/" topic as defined in the configuration:
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1884 -t data/ -m '{"frequency": 50, "power": 100, "temperature": 25, "humidity": 60}'
```
{:.copy-code}

Where:
- `-h` - specifies the MQTT broker's host address;
- `-p` - specifies the MQTT broker's port;
- `-t` - specifies the MQTT topic to publish to ("data/" in our case);
- `-m` - specifies the payload or message to publish. It should be in JSON format, following the structure defined in the mapping section of your configuration.

Adjust the payload values as needed.
