Json converter is default converter, it looks for deviceName, deviceType, attributes and telemetry in the incoming message from the broker, with rules, described in this subsection:

|**Parameter**|**Default value**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|-
| type                        | **json**                  | Provides information to connector that default converter will be uses for converting data from topic.                                     |
| deviceNameJsonExpression    | **SD8500**                | Simple JSON expression, uses for looking device name in the incoming message (string "SD8500" will be used as device name).               |
| deviceTypeJsonExpression    | **SD**                    | Simple JSON expression, uses for looking device type in the incoming message (string "SD" will be used as device type).                   |
| timeout                     | **60000**                 | Timeout for triggering "Device Disconnected" event                                                                                        |
| attributes                  |                           | This subsection contains parameters of the incoming message, that will be interpreted as attributes for the device.                       |
| ... type                    | **string**                | Type of incoming data for a current attribute.                                                                                            |
| ... key                     | **serialNumber**          | Attribute name, that will sends to ThingsBoard instance.                                                                                  |
| ... value                   | **${serial}**             | Simple JSON expression, uses for looking value in the incoming message, that will send to ThingsBoard instance as value of key parameter. |
| timeseries                  |                           | This subsection contains parameters of the incoming message, that will be interpreted as telemetry for the device.                        |
| ... type                    | **string**                | Type of incoming data for a current telemetry.                                                                                            |
| ... key                     | **Maintainer**            | Telemetry name, that will sends to ThingsBoard instance.                                                                                  |
| ... value                   | **${Developer}**          | Simple JSON expression, uses for looking value in the incoming message, that will send to ThingsBoard instance as value of key parameter. |
