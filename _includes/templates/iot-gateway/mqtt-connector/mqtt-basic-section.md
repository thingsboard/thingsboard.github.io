This configuration section contains settings of the MQTT broker connection, such as:
- **Host** - MQTT broker hostname or ip address;
- **Port** - listening port on the MQTT broker that will be used for establishing connection;
- **MQTT version** - MQTT protocol version (there are three versions currently supported by gateway - **3.1**, **3.11**, **5**);
- **Client ID** ** - Unique identifier for each client’s session on the broker;
- **Security** - configuration for client authorization at MQTT Broker (anonymous, basic, or certificates).

{% capture difference %}
**Please note:**
\** -- The broker (or broker cluster) does not allow two simultaneous sessions with the same **Client ID**. If a second connection uses that ID, 
the broker closes the existing session and accepts the new one (session takeover). The **Client ID** can be any valid UTF-8 string; 
if you don’t have a descriptive one, you can generate it in the MQTT connector configuration UI—see the last screenshot under this section.

All configuration parameters list, and their detailed description can be found in the

If you want the UI to generate a **Client ID**, leave the **Client ID** field blank and click *Generate Client ID* (see the screenshot below). 
The gateway will create a unique identifier, e.g., tb_gw_etm07 — this is just an example; your value will be different.
