This section in configuration file looks like:

```json

{% capture methodFilterOptions %}
There are 2 options for RPC request:
1. **With a response** -- If the configuration includes a responseTopicExpression, the gateway will attempt to subscribe to it and wait for a response.
2. **Without a response** -- If the configuration does not include a responseTopicExpression, the gateway will simply send the message without waiting for a response.
   {% endcapture %}
   {% include templates/info-banner.md content=methodFilterOptions %}

You can use **deviceNameFilter** and **methodFilter** to apply different mapping rules for various devices/methods.
Once Gateway receives RPC request from the server to the device, it will publish the corresponding message based on **requestTopicExpression** and **valueExpression**.
In case you expect a reply to the request from the device, you should also specify **responseTopicExpression** and **responseTimeout**.
The Gateway will subscribe to the "response" topic and wait for a device reply until "responseTimeout" is reached (in milliseconds).

Here is an example of an RPC request (rpc-request.json) that needs to be sent from the server:

```json
{
  "method": "echo",
  "params": {
    "message": "Hello!"
  }
}
```

Also, every telemetry and attribute parameter has built-in GET and SET RPC methods out of the box, so you donâ€™t need to configure
it manually. To use them, make sure you set all the required parameters (in the case of MQTT Connector, these are the following:
**requestTopicExpression**, **responseTopicExpression**, **responseTimeout**, **valueExpression**).
See [the guide](/docs/iot-gateway/guides/how-to-use-get-set-rpc-methods).
