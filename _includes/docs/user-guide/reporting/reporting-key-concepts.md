In ThingsBoard, **Reporting** is a powerful and flexible tool for collecting, structuring, and automatically distributing data in the form of reports.

Reporting in ThingsBoard is built on **two key components**:
- **Configured report template** – defines the structure, content, and format of the report. A template can be in **PDF** or **CSV** format and may include any supported components, such as tables, charts, text blocks, images, and more.
- **Scheduler event** – automatically triggers report generation at the specified time and sends it to selected recipients via available delivery channels (such as **email**, **Slack**, and other integrations).

<b><font size="3">Key features:</font></b><br>
- **Automated scheduling** – preconfigured scheduler events can send reports on a set schedule without any user action.
- **Reusable templates** – a single template can be used for different recipients by applying filters and parameters.
- **Event-based delivery** – send reports when specific events occur (e.g., an active alarm on a device).
- **Rich content support** – include text blocks, tables, charts, images, and more.
- **Notification integration** – attach a generated report to system notifications (Email, Slack).

<b><font size="3">Where it&#39;s useful:</font></b><br> 
- Regular monitoring of your device&#39;s metrics.
- Sharing summary data with partners or management.
- Archiving data in an easy-to-read format.
- Automating communication during incidents.

<br><b><font size="4">Report template</font></b>

A **report template** in ThingsBoard defines the structure, layout, and content of a report that will be generated by the system using the scheduler. It serves as the foundation for creating visually rich and functional reports in one of two formats:
- **PDF** – visually styled reports that may include charts, tables, images, and company branding.
- **CSV** – data-oriented tabular reports that are easy to analyze in Excel or BI tools.

**Example**:

## How to create a report template

- Open the "**Reporting**" page from the left-hand sidebar. You&#39;ll automatically be taken to the "**Templates**" tab.
- Click the "**+ Add report template**" button in the top-right corner.
- Choose "**Create new report template**".
- In the popup, fill out the following:
    - **Name** – a descriptive name for the report template.
    - **Format**: Choose **PDF** or **CSV** report format.
    - **Type**:
        - **Report** - a complete standalone report template.
        - [Subreport](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/reporting/subreport/){:target="_blank"} - a modular component that can be embedded inside another report.
    - Click "**Add**" to create the report template and open the **Report Builder** interface, where you can design the structure, layout, and content of your report.

## Report builder

The **Report Builder** is a drag-and-drop editor that lets you design your report template using visual and data components. You have full control over both the appearance and structure of the report.

Here&#39;s what the Report Builder looks like:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="report-builder" %}

## Components & Interaction

Templates are made up of customizable components, each serving as a visual or functional block. These components determine what will appear in your final report and how it will be presented.

<b><font size="4">Main component types:</font></b><br>

- **Text & Images.** - to add **text blocks**, **headings**, and **images** to your report. Text blocks supports plain or rich text and can include [dynamic placeholders](#variables--dynamic-content) for timestamps, entity names, user details, and more.
- **Tables** - to display **structured data (such as alarms, entities, and their telemetry) in table format**. Each table&#39;s style can be customized via the layout configuration tab — adjust column widths, font sizes, borders, and pagination.
- [**Subreport**](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/reporting/subreport/){:target="_blank"} is a modular report template that is embedded into a main report, inherits its context, and generates its own content accordingly.
- [**Dashboard**](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/reporting/embedding-dashboards-widgets/){:target="_blank"} - embeds a screenshot of the specified dashboard into the report as an image.
- [**Charts**](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/reporting/embedding-charts/){:target="_blank"} - to visualize time series data with configurable **line and bar charts**, or to present the latest values using different types of **pie and doughnut charts**.
- **Branding** - for adding **logos**, **headers**, and **footers** to customize the look and feel of reports.
- **Reporting Info & Layout** - supporting components (**split view**, **page number**, **created time**, **divider**, **page break**) to structure the report and display system metadata.

<b><font size="4">Component configuration</font></b><br>

Each component has two main configuration sections:
- **Data configuration** — defines which data the component will display and how it will be filtered. Supports [entity aliases](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/aliases/){:target="_blank"} and filters for dynamic data binding.
- **Layout configuration** — controls the visual style and formatting in the final document.

## Supported entity aliases

Report templates fully support the same [entity alias](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/aliases/){:target="_blank"} model as [dashboards](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/dashboards/){:target="_blank"} in ThingsBoard. Additionally, several new entity filters have been introduced:

- **Originator entity** - the entity that either originated the message sent to the "Generate Report" rule node or triggered the creation of a notification.
- **Owner of originator entity** - the owner of the entity that originated the message sent to the "Generate Report" rule node, or the owner of the entity that triggered the creation of a notification.

## Variables & dynamic content

In ThingsBoard, report components provide data as **variables** that can be directly referenced inside component elements. You can insert these variables anywhere text is allowed — for example, in a text block, table header, chart label, or other dynamic fields. This enables you to create highly personalized, context-aware reports.

<b><font size="3">System variables:</font></b><br>
System variables are available in any report or subreport, regardless of the connected data source.

Examples:
- **${pageNumber}** — displays the current page number in the report.
- **${totalPages}** — shows the total number of pages in the report.
- **${reportCreatedTime}** — stores the date and time when the report was created, in the format **yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss**.
- **${entityName}** - the technical or system name of the entity used in the report.
- **${entityLabel}** - A human-readable name of the entity.
- **${rowCount}** - displays the number of records (rows) contained in the table (applies to table components only).

<b><font size="3">Data source variables:</font></b><br>
Data source variables are generated based on the specified **data keys** (attributes or telemetry) from the **datasource** connected to the component (device, asset, etc.).
Each selected key automatically becomes available as a variable that can be inserted into any text field within the report.

Examples:
- **${status}** — value of the attribute or telemetry with the key *status*.
- **${temperature}** — value of the telemetry with the key *temperature*.
- **${voltage}** — value of the *voltage* key.

> **Note:** If the connected datasource does not contain a value for the specified key, the variable in the report will remain empty.

<b><font size="4">Using variables in the editor:</font></b><br>

- In the **Report Builder**, add a component (for example, Rich text) and, in the "**Data**" tab, specify its data source (target entity and data keys).
- Next, in the component&#39;s text field, type the `$` symbol where you want to insert a variable&#39;s value. This will open a list of all available variables in the current context.
- **Select a variable** (for example, ${reportCreatedTime}), and its value will be inserted into the report during generation.
- Continue entering text and adding variables as needed.
- When finished, click the "**Save**" button in the top-right corner to apply your changes.

To verify the result, generate a test report sample by clicking the corresponding button in the top-right corner.

## Importing report template

Do you have a ready-made report template in `.json` format? Simply click "**Import report template**" and upload your file — all configurations and components will be brought in automatically.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="import-report-template" %}

## Scheduler

The <b>Scheduler</b> in ThingsBoard is an automation mechanism for generating reports.
It lets you configure automatic creation and delivery of reports at a specified time, based on a pre-built Report Template.

For step-by-step guidance, see: [Scheduling reports](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/reporting/scheduling-reports/){:target="_blank"}.
