A **Customer** in ThingsBoard represents a distinct business entity — an individual or an organization — that purchases or uses a tenant&#39;s devices and/or assets. A customer may also represent a department or subdivision within the tenant&#39;s organization.

Customers can scale from small units to large ecosystems with many users, sub‑customers, and large numbers of devices and assets.

**Who can manage customers?**

[Tenant Administrators](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/tenants/){:target="_blank"} can create and manage customer groups and individual customers.

**What can customers do?**

Once created, customers can manage their own environment, including:

- Creating and managing **customer users**;
- Adding and editing **devices, assets, dashboards**, and other entities.

## Create new customer

The tenant administrator can add a new customer using the following steps.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="customer-add-new-pe" showListImageTitles="true" %}

{% capture difference %}
**Note:** By default, new customers are placed in the "All" customer group. You can choose or create a different group during the creation flow. Read more information about entity groups [here](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/groups/){:target="_blank"}.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=difference %}

<br><b>Let&#39;s create another customer and a separate customer group for it.</b>

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="customer-add-new-2-pe" showListImageTitles="true" %}

<hr>

## Create customer user

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="add-customer-user" showListImageTitles="true" %}

{% capture difference %}
Customer users created in the "**All**" group start with **limited permissions**. You can configure their permissions later by assigning **roles**. [Learn how in this article](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rbac/){:target="_blank"}.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=difference %}

## Edit customer or customer user

The Tenant administrator can edit the title, specify a home dashboard and edit the rest of the fields for the customer.
Let’s see how to do this:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="edit-customer-pe" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Also, you can edit customer user information.

The steps are similar to how we edit the customer:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="edit-customer-user" showListImageTitles="true" %}

<hr>

## Delete customer or customer user

The tenant administrator can delete a customer along with all its customer users using one of the following ways:

First way:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="delete-customer-pe" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Second way:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="delete-customer-2-pe" showListImageTitles="true" %}

You can also delete multiple customers at once.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="delete-customer-3-pe" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Also, you can delete any customer user from the customer. The steps are the same as when deleting a customer.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="delete-customer-user-1" showListImageTitles="true" %}

## Customer details

Clicking on a customer opens a details window where you can view and manage all aspects related to that customer.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="customer-details-page" %}

<b><font size="3">Copy customer ID</font></b>   
Allows you to quickly retrieve the customer’s unique UUID. Click Copy customer Id to copy it to your clipboard. This ID is used in API calls, integrations, and automation scripts.

<b><font size="3">Attributes</font></b>

This tab displays client, server, and shared [attributes](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/attributes/){:target="_blank"} associated with the customer. These are static or semi-static key-value pairs, such as contact information, region, account parameters, or custom metadata.

<b><font size="3">Latest telemetry</font></b>

Shows the [latest telemetry](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/telemetry/){:target="_blank"} values linked to the customer. Telemetry can be generated by customer-related devices, services, or added manually for analytics and modeling purposes.
- **Adding telemetry:** Click the "**+**" icon, then define the key, value type, and value.
- **Deleting telemetry:** Click the trash icon, select the deletion mode (all data, latest value, all except latest, or by time range), and confirm the action.

<b><font size="3">Calculated fields</font></b>   
Displays fields whose values are computed from existing attributes or telemetry using formulas. Useful for deriving additional business metrics at the customer level. Learn more about Calculated fields [here](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/calculated-fields/){:target="_blank"}.

<b><font size="3">Alarm rules</font></b>   
Contains alarm rules configured for the customer. These rules define how alarms are generated based on customer-level data or associated assets/devices. Learn more about configuring alarm rules [here](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/alarm-rules/){:target="_blank"}.

<b><font size="3">Alarms</font></b>  
Shows all active and historical [alarms](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/alarms/){:target="_blank"} related to the customer. Helps track operational issues, warnings, and critical events affecting the customer or their infrastructure.

<b><font size="3">Events</font></b>   
Displays system events associated with the customer — logs, warnings, errors, and lifecycle activities. Useful for diagnostics and monitoring customer-related operations.

<b><font size="3">Relations</font></b>   
Shows all directed [relationships](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/entities-and-relations/#relations){:target="_blank"} between the customer and other entities, such as assets, devices, dashboards, or rule chains. Provides a structural overview of the customer's environment in the system.

<b><font size="3">Audit logs</font></b>   
Provides a [record of user actions](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/audit-log/){:target="_blank"} related to the customer — creation, updates, configuration changes, and deletions. Supports security auditing and change tracking.

<b><font size="3">Version control</font></b>   
Allows exporting and restoring customer-related entities using the Git-based [version control](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/version-control/){:target="_blank"} service. Useful for backups, collaborative workflows, and configuration versioning.
