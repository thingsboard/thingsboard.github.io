## Introduction

A Customer can be a separate business-entity: an individual, or an organization that purchases or uses tenant devices and/or assets. 
Customer can also be a division within the tenant organization. 
Customer can have multiple users, inner customers, and millions of devices and/or assets.

[Tenant administrators](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/tenants/) can create customer groups and customers. 
In turn, customers have an opportunity to add and edit their own customers, users, assets, devices, entity views, and dashboards.
All of these you and your customers are able to do in the user details:
to manage such options as customer groups, [user groups](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/users/), [asset groups](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/assets/),
[device groups](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/devices/), [entity view groups](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/entity-views/),
[dashboard groups](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/dashboards/), [edges](/docs/pe/edge/), and [delete a customer](#delete-customer).


## Create new customer

The tenant administrator can add a new customer using the following steps.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="customer-add-new-pe" showListImageTitles="true" %}

In this case, the new customer will be located in the "All" customer's group.
You can specify a separate group during the process of creating a customer.

Let's create another client and a separate customer group for it.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="customer-add-new-2-pe" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Read more information about entity groups [here](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/groups/).

## Create customer user

The tenant administrator can add a customer user to his account with limited permissions. Permissions for the new customer user can be configured later with the help of [Roles](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rbac/).

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="add-customer-user" showListImageTitles="true" %}

## Edit customer or customer user

The Tenant administrator can edit the title, specify a home dashboard and edit the rest of the fields for the customer.
Letâ€™s see how to do this:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="edit-customer-pe" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Also, you can edit customer user information.

The steps are similar to how we edit the customer:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="edit-customer-user" showListImageTitles="true" %}

## Delete customer or customer user

The tenant administrator can delete a customer along with all its customer users using one of the following ways:

First way:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="delete-customer-pe" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Second way:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="delete-customer-2-pe" showListImageTitles="true" %}

You can also delete multiple customers at once.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="delete-customer-3-pe" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Also, you can delete any customer user from the customer. The steps are the same as when deleting a customer.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="delete-customer-user-1" showListImageTitles="true" %}
