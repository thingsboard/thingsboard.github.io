### Tenants overview

ThingsBoard supports [Multitenancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy) out-of-the-box.
You can treat ThingsBoard Tenant as a separate business-entity: individual or organization who owns or produces devices.

The **System administrator** is able to create one or more tenant entities.
Tenant may have multiple tenant administrator users and enormous number of customers, devices and assets.

### Сreate a new Tenant

To add a new **Tenant**, please follow the instructions below:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="create-tenants-ce" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Learn more about tenant profiles [here](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/tenant-profiles).

<br/>
On the Tenant details page, you as the System administrator can view the attributes, the latest telemetry, assign the home dashboard, and copy the tenant ID.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="tenant-details-ce" %}

### Сreate Tenant Administrator

The **System administrator** is also able to create multiple users with **Tenant administrator** role in each tenant.

To add the User follow the instructions below:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="create-tenant-admin-ce" showListImageTitles="true" %}

In a tenant details window, the System administrator can use the following action tabs:

1) **Disable the User account**.

2) **Display activation link** shows the activation link for the Tenant administrator user.

3) **Resend activation** resends the account activation email to the user’s email box.

4) **Login as Tenant administrator** opens the Thingsboard platform from the Tenant administrator UI.

5) The System Administrator can also **Delete user** from both the user details page and tenant admins list.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="user-details-ce" %}

Learn more about user creating process [here](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/users).

### Edit Tenant or User

In the Tenant details you can edit all fields.

Let's see how to do this:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="tenant-edit-ce" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Also, you can edit the **user**.

The steps are similar to how we edit the tenant:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="user-edit-ce" showListImageTitles="true" %}

### Delete Tenant or User

You can delete the **Tenant** at once with all its users. To do this, click on the "trash" icon and then also confirm the deletion by clicking on "Yes".

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="tenant-delete-1-ce" %}

In addition, there is an option to delete the user using the action tab in Tenant details window.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="tenant-delete-2-ce" %}

Also, you can delete any **user** from the Tenant. To do this, go to the Tenant, find the user you need and click on the "trash" icon. After clicking, a warning window will appear. If you are sure you want to delete the user, click on "Yes".

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="user-delete-ce" %}

In addition, there is an option to delete the Tenant using the action tab in Tenant details window.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="user-delete-2-ce" %}

### Login as a Tenant Administrator

If you need to log in as a tenant, just open the tenant group and click the icon opposite to the user account to log in as this tenant.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="tenant-login-ce" %}

The Tenant Administrator is able to do following actions:

- Provision and Manage [Devices](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/devices).
- Provision and Manage [Assets](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/assets).
- Create and Manage [Customers](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/customers).
