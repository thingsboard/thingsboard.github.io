All [IoT Dashboards](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/dashboards/) are constructed using **ThingsBoard widgets** defined in the Widget Library.

A widget is an element that displays a specific type of information or functionality on a dashboard.
Widgets are used to display data and visualize information obtained from devices connected to the ThingsBoard platform, remote device control, alarms management, and display static custom HTML content.
