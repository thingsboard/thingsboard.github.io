ThingsBoard Rule Engine is a highly customizable and configurable system for complex event processing. 
With rule engine you are able to filter, enrich and transform incoming messages originated by IoT devices and related assets. 
You are also able to trigger various actions, for example, notifications or communication with external systems.
  
## Key Concepts

#### Rule Engine Message 

Rule Engine Message is a serializable, immutable data structure that represent various messages in the system. For example:

  * Incoming [telemetry](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/telemetry/), [attribute update](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/attributes/) or [RPC call](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rpc/) from device;
  * Entity life-cycle event: created, updated, deleted, assigned, unassigned, attributes updated;
  * Device status event: connected, disconnected, active, inactive, etc;
  * Other system events.
  
Rule Engine Message contains the following information:

  * Message ID: time based, universally unique identifier;
  * Originator of the message: Device, Asset or other [Entity](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/entities-and-relations/) identifier;
  * Type of the message: "Post telemetry" or "Inactivity Event", etc;
  * Payload of the message: JSON body with actual message payload;
  * Metadata: List of key-value pairs with additional data about the message. 

#### Rule Node

Rule Node is a basic component of Rule Engine that process single incoming message at a time and produce one or more outgoing messages. 
Rule Node is a main logical unit of the Rule Engine. Rule Node can filter, enrich, transform incoming messages, perform action or communicate with external systems.

#### Rule Node Relation

Rule Nodes may be related to other rule nodes. Each relation has relation type, a label used to identify logical meaning of the relation. 
When rule node produces the outgoing message it always specifies the relation type which is used to route message to next nodes.
 
Typical rule node relations are "Success" and "Failure". 
Rule nodes that represent logical operations may use "True" or "False". 
Some specific rule nodes may use completely different relation types, for example: "Post Telemetry", "Attributes Updated", "Entity Created", etc. 

#### Rule Chain

Rule Chain is a logical group of rule nodes and their relations. For example, the rule chain below will:

  * save all telemetry messages to the database;
  * raise "High Temperature Alarm" if temperature field in the message will be higher then 50 degrees;
  * raise "Low Temperature Alarm" if temperature field in the message will be lower then -40 degrees;
  * log failure to execute the temperature check scripts to console in case of logical or syntax error in the script.

Tenant administrator is able to define one **Root Rule Chain** and optionally multiple other rule chains. 
Root rule chain handles all incoming messages and may forward them to other rule chains for additional processing.
Other rule chains may also forward messages to different rule chains.

For example, the rule chain below will:

  * raise "High Temperature Alarm" if temperature field in the message will be higher then 50 degrees;
  * clear "High Temperature Alarm" if temperature field in the message will be less then 50 degrees;
  * forward events about "Created" and "Cleared" alarms to external rule chain that handles notifications to corresponding users.

#### Message Processing Result

There are three possible results of message processing: Success, Failure and Timeout.
The message processing attempt is marked as "Success" when the last rule node in the processing chain successfully process the message.
The message processing attempt is marked as "Failure" if one of the rule nodes produce "Failure" of message processing, 
and there is no rule nodes to handle that failure. 
The message processing attempt is marked as "Timeout" when overall time of processing exceed configurable threshold.

See diagram below and let's review the possible scenarios:

![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/not-a-failure.png)

If the "Transformation" script fails, the message is not marked as "Failed", because there is a "Save to DB" node connected with "Failure" relation.
If the "Transformation" script is successful, it will be pushed to "External System" with the REST API call.
If the external system is overloaded, the REST API call may "hang" for some time. 
Let's assume the overall timeout for message pack processing is 20 seconds. Let's ignore Transformation script execution time because it is < 1ms.
So, if the "External System" will reply within 20 seconds, the message will be successfully processed. 
Similar, if "Save to DB" call will succeed, the message will be successfully processed. 
However, if the external system will not reply within 20 seconds, the message processing attempt will be marked as "timed-out".
Similar, if "Save to DB" call will fail, the message will be marked as failed.

#### Rule Engine Queue

Rule Engine subscribe to queues on startup and polls for new messages. 
There is always "Main" topic that is used as a main entry point for new incoming messages. 
You may configure multiple queues using thingsboard.yml or environment variables.
Once configured, you may put message to the other topic using "Checkpoint" node. 
This automatically acknowledges corresponding message in the current topic.

The definition of the queue consists of the following parameters:

 * name - used for statistics and logging;
 * topic - used by Queue implementations to produce and consume messages;
 * poll-interval - duration in milliseconds between polling of the messages if no new messages arrive;
 * partitions - number of partitions to associate with this queue. Used for scaling the number of messages that can be processed in parallel;
 * pack-processing-timeout - interval in milliseconds for processing of the particular pack of messages returned by consumer;
 * submit-strategy - defines logic and order of submitting messages to rule engine. See separate paragraph below.
 * processing-strategy - defines logic of acknowledgement of the messages. See separate paragraph below.
  
##### Queue submit strategy

Rule Engine service constantly polls messages for specific topic and once the Consumer returns a list of messages it creates the TbMsgPackProcessingContext object.
Queue submit strategy controls how messages from TbMsgPackProcessingContext are submitted to rule chains. There are 5 available strategies:

 * BURST - all messages are submitted to the rule chains in the order they arrive.  
 * BATCH - messages are grouped to batches using "queue.rule-engine.queues\[queue index\].batch-size" configuration parameter. 
 New batch is not submitted until previous batch is acknowledged.
 * SEQUENTIAL_BY_ORIGINATOR - messages are submitted sequentially within particular entity (originator of the message). 
 New message for e.g. device A is not submitted until previous message for device A is acknowledged. 
 * SEQUENTIAL_BY_TENANT - messages are submitted sequentially within tenant (owner of the originator of the message). 
 New message for e.g tenant A is not submitted until previous message for tenant A is acknowledged.
 * SEQUENTIAL  - messages are submitted sequentially. New message is not submitted until previous message is acknowledged. This makes processing quite slow.
 
See this [guide](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-5/tutorials/queues-for-synchronization/) for an example of submit strategy use case.

##### Queue processing strategy
  
Processing Strategy controls how failed or timed out messages are re-processed. There are 5 available strategies:

 * SKIP_ALL_FAILURES - simply ignore all failures and timeouts. Will cause messages to be "lost". 
 For example, if DB is down, the messages will not be persisted but will be still marked as "acknowledged" and deleted from queue.
 This strategy is created mostly for backward-compatibility with previous releases and development/demo environments.
 * RETRY_ALL - retry all messages from processing pack. 
 If 1 out of 100 messages will fail, strategy will still reprocess (resubmit to Rule Engine) 100 messages. 
 * RETRY_FAILED - retry all failed messages from processing pack. 
 If 1 out of 100 messages will fail, strategy will reprocess(resubmit to Rule Engine) only 1 message. 
 Timed-out messages will not be reprocessed.
 * RETRY_TIMED_OUT - retry all timed-out messages from processing pack. 
 If 1 out of 100 messages will timeout, strategy will reprocess(resubmit to Rule Engine) only 1 message.
 Failed messages will not be reprocessed.
 * RETRY_FAILED_AND_TIMED_OUT - retry all failed and timed-out messages from processing pack.
 
All "RETRY*" strategies support important configuration parameters:  
 
 * retries - Number of retries, 0 is unlimited
 * failure-percentage - Skip retry if failures or timeouts are less then X percentage of messages;
 * pause-between-retries - Time in seconds to wait in consumer thread before retries;
 
 See this [guide](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-5/tutorials/queues-for-message-reprocessing/) for an example of processing strategy use case.

##### Default queues

There are three default queues configured: Main, HighPriority and SequentialByOriginator.
They differ based on submit and processing strategy.
Basically, rule engine process messages from Main topic and may optionally put them to other topics using "Checkpoint" rule node. 
Main topic simply ignores failed messages by default. This is done for backward compatibility with previous releases. 
However, you may reconfigure this at your own risk. 
Note that if one message is not processed due to some failure in your rule node script, it may prevent next messages from being processed.
We have designed specific [dashboard](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/overview/#rule-engine-statistics) to monitor Rule Engine processing and failures. 

The HighPriority topic may be used for delivery of alarms or other critical processing steps. 
The messages in HighPriority topic are constantly reprocessed in case of failure until the message processing succeeds. 
This is useful if you have an outage of the SMTP server or external system. The Rule Engine will retry sending the message until it is processed.   

The SequentialByOriginator topic is important if you would like to make sure that messages are processed in correct order.
Messages from the same entity will be processed with the order they arrive to the queue. 
Rule Engine will not submit new message to the rule chain until the previous message for the same entity id is acknowledged.

## Rule Node Types

All available rule nodes are grouped in correspondence with their nature:

  * [**Filter Nodes**](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/filter-nodes/) are used for message filtering and routing;
  * [**Enrichment Nodes**](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/enrichment-nodes/) are used to update meta-data of the incoming Message;
  * [**Transformation Nodes**](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/transformation-nodes/) are used for changing incoming Message fields like Originator, Type, Payload, Metadata;
  * [**Action Nodes**](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/action-nodes/) execute various actions based on incoming Message;
  * [**External Nodes**](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/external-nodes/) are used to interact with external systems.

## Configuration

Each Rule Node may have specific configuration parameters that depend on the Rule Node Implementation. 
For example, "Filter - script" rule node is configurable via custom JS function that process incoming data. 
"External - send email" node configuration allows to specify mail server connection parameters.
  
Rule Node configuration window may be opened by double-clicking on the node in the Rule Chain editor:    
  
![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/rule-node-configuration.png)

### Test JavaScript functions

Some rule nodes have specific UI feature that allow users to test JS functions. 
Once you click on the **Test Filter Function** you will see the JS Editor that allows you to substitute input parameters and verify the output of the function.
    
![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/rule-node-test-function.png)

You can define:

- **Message Type** in the top left field.
- **Message payload** in the left Message section.
- **Metadata** in right Metadata section.
- Actual **JS script** in Filter section.

After pressing **Test** output will be returned in right **Output** section.

## Rule Engine Statistics

ThingsBoard Team have prepared the "default" dashboard for Rule Engine statistics. 
This dashboard is automatically loaded for each tenant. 
You may access it by navigating to "Api Usage"->"View statistics" (see screen below).

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="open-statistics"  %}

The statistics collection is enabled by default and is controlled via configuration properties.

You may notice insights about errors in processing and what causes them on the dashbaord below: 

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="view-statistics"  %}

## Debugging

ThingsBoard provides ability to review incoming and outgoing messages for each Rule Node.
To enable debug, user need to ensure that "Debug mode" checkbox is selected in the main configuration window 
(see first image in the [Configuration](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/overview/#configuration) section). 

Once debug is enabled, user is able to see incoming and outgoing messages info as long as corresponding relation types.
See image below for a sample debug messages view:
  
![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/rule-node-debug.png)  

## Import/Export

You are able to export your rule chain to JSON format and import it to the same or another ThingsBoard instance.

In order to export rule chain, you should navigate to the **Rule Chains** page and click on the export button located on the particular rule chain card.
 
![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/rule-chain-export.png)

Similar, to import the rule chain you should navigate to the **Rules Chains** page and click on the big "+" button in the bottom-right part of the screen and then click on the import button. 

## Architecture

To learn more about internals of the rule engine, see [architecture](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/architecture/) page.

## Custom REST API calls to Rule Engine

{% assign feature = "Custom Rule Engine REST API calls" %}{% include templates/pe-feature-banner.md %}

ThingsBoard provides API to send custom REST API calls to the rule engine, process the payload of the request and return result of the processing in response body. 
This is useful for a number of use cases. For example:
 
 - extend existing REST API of the platform with custom API calls;
 - enrich REST API call with the attributes of device/asset/customer and forward to external system for complex processing;
 - provide custom API for your custom widgets.
 
To execute the REST API call, you may use rule-engine-controller [REST APIs](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}reference/rest-api/): 
 
![image](/images/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/rest-api.png) 

Note: the entity id you have specified in the call will be the originator of Rule Engine message. If you do not specify the entity id parameters, your user entity will become an originator of the message.

## Tutorials

ThingsBoard authors have prepared several tutorials to help you get started with designing rule chains by example:

  * [**Transform incoming messages from device**](/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/transform-incoming-telemetry/) 
  * [**Transform incoming messages using previous messages from device**](/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/transform-telemetry-using-previous-record/) 
  * [**Create and clear alarms on incoming device messages**](/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/create-clear-alarms/)
  * [**Send emails to customer on device alarm**](/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/send-email/) 
  * [**Send messages between related devices**](/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/rpc-reply-tutorial/)

## Troubleshooting

If you are using Kafka queue for processing messages, ThingsBoard provides the ability to monitor if the rate of pushing messages to the Kafka is faster than rate of consuming and processing them (in such case you will have a growing latency for message processing).
To enable this functionality, you need to ensure that Kafka consumer-stats are enabled (see <b>queue.kafka.consumer-stats</b> section of the [Configuration properties](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/install/config/#thingsboard-core-settings))

Once Kafka consumer-stats are enabled, you will see logs (see [Troubleshooting](/docs/user-guide/troubleshooting/#logs)) about offset lag for consumer groups (there are consumer-group logs for tb-core, tb-rule-engine and all transport services).

Here's an example of the log message:

```bash
2021-03-19 15:01:59,794 [kafka-consumer-stats-11-thread-1] INFO  o.t.s.q.k.TbKafkaConsumerStatsService - [re-Main-consumer] Topic partitions with lag: [[topic=[tb_rule_engine.main.0], partition=[0], committedOffset=[5413], endOffset=[5418], lag=[5]]].
```

From this message we can see that there are 5 (5418 - 5413 = 5) messages pushed to the <b>Main</b> queue (<b>tb_rule_engine.main.0</b> Kafka topic) but not yet processed. 

In general the logs have the following structure:

```bash
TIME [STATS_PRINTING_THREAD_NAME] INFO  o.t.s.q.k.TbKafkaConsumerStatsService - [CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME] Topic partitions with lag: [[topic=[KAFKA_TOPIC], partition=[KAFKA_TOPIC_PARTITION], committedOffset=[LAST_PROCESSED_MESSAGE_OFFSET], endOffset=[LAST_QUEUED_MESSAGE_OFFSET], lag=[LAG]],[topic=[ANOTHER_TOPIC], partition=[], committedOffset=[], endOffset=[], lag=[]],...].
```

Where:
- `CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME` - name of the consumer group which is processing messages (could be any of the rule-engine queues, core queue etc)
- `KAFKA_TOPIC` - name of the exact Kafka topic
- `KAFKA_TOPIC_PARTITION` - number of the topic's partition
- `LAST_PROCESSED_MESSAGE_OFFSET` - the sequence number of the last message which was processed by the consumer (last acknowledged message in the Rule Engine etc)
- `LAST_QUEUED_MESSAGE_OFFSET` - the sequence number of the last message that was successfully pushed to the Kafka topic
- `LAG` - the amount of unprocessed messages


**NOTE:** Logs about consumer lag are printed only if there is a lag for this consumer group.
