Routes incoming messages based on the name of the profile of the originator asset.

## Preconditions

Incoming message originator entity type must be an `ASSET`.

## Configuration

### Field descriptions

There are no available configuration fields.

### JSON Schema

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "title": "EmptyNodeConfiguration",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {},
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

## Message processing algorithm

1. Checks whether incoming message originator entity type is an `ASSET`.
    1. If the incoming message originator entity type is not an `ASSET`, processing end with a `Failure`.
2. Fetches the profile of that asset from the database to get profile name.
    1. If profile was not found (possible if originator no longer exist at the time of message processing), processing ends with a `Failure`.
3. Routes the incoming message to downstream nodes using connection with a label that matches exactly with fetched profile name.

> Note: The incoming message is not modified.

## Output connections

* Asset profile name:
    * If incoming message originator entity type is an `ASSET` and profile for that asset was found.
* `Failure`:
    * If the incoming message originator entity type is not an `ASSET`.
    * If the profile for the incoming message originator was not found.
    * If another unexpected error occurred during message processing.

## Examples

The examples below show only the **relevant** fields of the incoming message. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, other message fields may have any values.

---

### Example 1 — Originator entity type is an `ASSET` with profile “Boiler Room” → routed via **`Boiler Room`**

**Incoming message**

Originator entity type is an `ASSET`.

**Node configuration**

```json
{}
```

**State of the system**

The asset exists and its **profile name** is `Boiler Room`.

**Result**

Routed via **`Boiler Room`**.

**Explanation**

The node fetches the asset’s profile and uses the **exact profile name** as the connection label.

---

### Example 2 — Originator entity type is **not** an `ASSET` → **`Failure`**

**Incoming message**

Originator entity type is not an `ASSET`. For example, it could be a `DEVICE` or any other entity type.

**Node configuration**

```json
{}
```

**State of the system**

Not relevant.

**Result**

**`Failure`**.

**Explanation**

The node requires the originator entity type to be an `ASSET`.

---

### Example 3 — Asset was not found at processing time → **`Failure`**

**Incoming message**

Originator entity type is an `ASSET`.

**Node configuration**

```json
{}
```

**State of the system**

No asset with this ID exists (e.g., it was deleted while message was in queue).

**Result**

**`Failure`**.

**Explanation**

The node cannot fetch the asset’s profile.

## Use cases

Experienced platform users utilize asset profiles and configure specific rule chains per asset profile.
This is useful to automatically route messages the platform generates: Entity Created, Entity Deleted, Attributes Updated, etc.
But most of the messages are derived from the sensor data.
Let's assume we have temperature sensors in the room assets with profiles: "Freezer Room" and "Boiler Room".
We also take it that there is a relation between the room asset and the temperature device of type "Contains".
You can configure a rule chain that will change the originator of the message from the device to the related asset and route the incoming messages to the "Freezer Room" or "Boiler
Room" rule chains.
