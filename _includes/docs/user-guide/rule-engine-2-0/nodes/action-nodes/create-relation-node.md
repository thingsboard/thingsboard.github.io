Create the relation from the selected entity to originator of the message by type and direction.

Following Message Originator types are allowed: **Asset**, **Device**, **Entity View**, **Customer**, **Tenant**, **Dashboard**.

Finds target Entity by metadata key patterns and then create a relation between Originator Entity and the target entity.

If selected entity type **Asset**, **Device** or **Customer**  rule node will create new Entity if it doesnâ€™t exist and selected checkbox: **Create new Entity if not exists**.

**Note:** if selected entity type **Asset** or **Device** you need to set two patterns:

- entity name pattern;

- entity type pattern.

Otherwise, only name pattern should be set.
