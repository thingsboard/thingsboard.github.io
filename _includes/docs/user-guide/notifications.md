## Overview

ThingsBoard Notification Center allows you to send notifications to the end-users. 
You may send notifications manually, via REST API, or based on a specific trigger event.
You may also schedule delivery of the notification for a particular time. 

To go to the notification center, click on “Notification center” in the sidebar menu.
On this page you see the button to send a notification and five tabs: "Inbox", "Sent", "Recipients", "Templates" and "Rules".

{% endif %}

Let's look at each of the key components of the notification center below.

### Notification options available in ThingsBoard

Each notification may be delivered using multiple delivery methods: Web, SMS, Email, or [Slack](https://slack.com/).

- **Web**. The notification will be sent to the Web UI in Thingsboard;
- **SMS**. The notification is sent to the user's phone. To send notifications via SMS, a system administrator should set up the [SMS provider](/docs/user-guide/ui/sms-provider-settings/) properly;
- **Email**. With this approach, the user receives a notification by Email. To send notifications via Email, a tenant administrator [outgoing mail server](/docs/user-guide/ui/mail-settings/) should be configured;
- **Slack**. Notifications will send as a Slack message to the list of Users or Channels. To send notifications via Slack, a tenant administrator must configure a Slack API [token](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types) in the *Settings* -> *Notifications* tab. Learn more about how to configure Slack settings in Thingsboard [here](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/slack-settings/).

### Send notification

To send a notification manually, follow these steps:

 - Сlick the “Send notification” button in the upper right corner of the "Notification center" page to open the new notification wizard;
 - Select recipients and one or more delivery methods. In this example, let's consider the Web delivery method. Click "Next";
 - Enter the subject and text of the message;
 - Also you can use the Action button in the notification. Enter the button text, select the action type ("Open dashboard" or "Open URL link") and specify the URL link or dashboard that should open when the button is clicked. You can also display the icon and set its color. Click "Next";
 - In this window, you can see how the notification will look and also view the list of notification recipients. Click "Send";
 - User received a new notification. The user can view it by clicking on the bell icon in the upper right corner of the screen or in the Notification center page;
 - By clicking on the "Open this dashboard" button in the message, the user will open the dashboard window.

### Inbox

The "Inbox" tab displays unread notifications by default. 
You may use the inbox table to browse the notifications and mark them as read. 
You may also switch the view to browse all notifications.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-inbox" %}

You can also view incoming notifications by clicking on the bell icon in the top right corner of the screen. 
The number next to the icon indicates the number of unread messages. 
Here you can read the notification, mark it as read, or take action by clicking the action button.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-inbox-bell-icon" %}

### Sent 

The "Sent" tab displays the status of sent notifications. 
You may use the "Notify again" button to copy an existing notification and send it again. 

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-sent" %}

Also, you may investigate issues with the delivery of certain notifications here. 
In case of delivery issues, the corresponding notification row will have information about the recipient who missed the update. 
This typically happens when the email address is wrong, or the phone number is not configured.

If you decide to delete an outgoing message, it will also be deleted for all recipients. This only applies to the Web delivery method.

### Recipients

The "Recipients" tab displays the list of notification recipient groups. You may create and delete notification recipient groups here.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-recipients" %}

To add notification recipients, follow these steps:

 - Click the "Add recipients" button in the upper right corner of the Recipients tab;
 - In the new window, enter the name of the notification recipients;
 - Next, select one of the two types of recipients: platform users and Slack entities. Recipients group defines either a set of platform users or set of Slack entities;
 - From the "User filter" list, select who you want to send messages or notifications to;
 - Click "Add".

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-recipients-1" %}

You can also add a new recipient at the stage of creating a new notification:

 - Start creating a new notification. In the "New notification" window (in the "Recipients" field) click the "Create new" button;
 - Enter the name of the notification recipients;
 - Next, select one of the two types of recipients: platform users and Slack entities. Recipients group defines either a set of platform users or set of Slack entities;
 - From the "User filter" list, select who you want to send messages or notifications to;
 - Click "Add".

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-recipients-2" %}

###### Platform users

There are several user filters that help you to define a recipient group. The scope of the filter depends on the role of the user that creates the recipient group.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-platform-users" %}

For **System Administrator**:

 * *All users* - all users of the platform. Includes all tenant administrators and all customer users;

 * *Tenant administrators* - set of tenant administrator users that are selected based on the list of tenants or their tenant profiles;

 * *Affected tenant administrators*;

 * *System administrators*.

For **Tenant Administrator**:

 * *All users* - all users of the current tenant. Includes the tenant administrator and all customer users;

 * *Tenant administrators* - all administrators of the current tenant;

 * *User list* - selected users;

{% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix == "paas/") %}
 * *User group list* - selected user group;
{% endif %}

 * *Customer users* - all users that belong to customers of the current tenant;

{% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix == "paas/") %}
 * *User role* - selected user role;
{% endif %}

 * *Users of the entity owner* - all users that belong to the entity owner. For example, users of the customer that owns the device or tenant administrators if the device is not assigned to the customer;

 * *Affected user* - The user that is affected by the notification trigger event. For example, the person that is assigned to investigate the alarm event.

###### Slack entities

As a platform user, you may send notifications as a Slack message to a list of Users or Channels. Both public and private channels and direct messages are supported.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-recipients-slack" %}

### Templates

The "Templates" tab displays the list of notification templates. You may create, copy and delete notification templates here.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-templates" %}

The template defines the content of the notification and the set of delivery methods to use.
Each template contains a notification subject and message. 
The user may adjust the notification content for specific delivery methods. 
For example, you may use a concise message for SMS and an advanced HTML template for the Email.

Notification subject and message fields support templatization. The list of available templatization parameters depends on the template type. See the available types and parameters below.
Parameter names must be wrapped using `${...}`. For example: `${recipientFirstName}`. 
You may also modify the value of the parameter with one of the sufixes:

 * `upperCase`, for example - `${recipientFirstName:upperCase}`
 * `lowerCase`, for example - `${recipientFirstName:lowerCase}`
 * `capitalize`, for example - `${recipientFirstName:capitalize}`

To create a new template, follow these steps:

- Click the "Add template" button in the upper right corner of the "Templates" window;
- In the new window, enter the notification template name;
- Select a template from the template type list;
- Next, select one or more delivery methods. In this example, let’s consider the Web delivery method. Click "Next";
- Enter the subject and text of the message;
- Also you can use the Action button in the notification. Enter the button name, select the action type ("Open dashboard" or "Open URL link") and specify the URL link or dashboard that should open when the button is clicked. You can also display the icon and set its color. Click "Next";
- Click "Add".
