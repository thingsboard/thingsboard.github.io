The ThingsBoard Notification center is a comprehensive tool for sending, managing, and automating notifications within the platform. It allows for a variety of notification methods, including web, email, mobile application, SMS, and integrations with Slack and Microsoft Teams. 
Users can manually send notifications, automate them through REST API, or set triggers based on events within the system. Users may also schedule delivery of the notification for a particular time.

The Notification center is accessible through the sidebar menu and includes options for [sending notifications](#send-notification), viewing [inbox](#inbox) and [sent](#sent) messages, [managing recipients](#recipients), [creating templates](#templates), and [setting up rules](#rules) for automated notifications.

{% endif %}
{% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix contains "paas/") %}
![image](/images/user-guide/notifications/notification-center-1-pe.png)
{% endif %}

Let's look at each of the key components of the notification center below.

## Notification delivery methods

ThingsBoard offers several notification delivery methods to keep you and your customers promptly informed about any events in your IoT solution:

- **Web**. Receive notifications directly within the ThingsBoard web interface. This is perfect for users who are always logged in.
- **Mobile app**. Receive instant push notifications directly to your smartphone through the [{{mobilePrefix}}]({{mobileUrl}}). Stay informed about all events in your IoT solution, even when you're on the go.<br>
To use this notification delivery method, you first need to configure the {{mobilePrefix}} and make some settings in the "Mobile settings" section on the ThingsBoard platform itself.
These steps are detailed in this [documentation]({{mobileGuide}}).
- **SMS**. The ThingsBoard supports notification delivery via SMS to mobile devices, providing the ability to deliver important information even in the absence of internet access. {% if docsPrefix == 'pe/' %}To send SMS notifications, you need to set up an [SMS provider](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/sms-provider-settings/). Use the system administrator's configuration or set the settings at your level.{% endif %}{% if docsPrefix == null %}To send notifications via SMS, a system administrator should set up the [SMS provider](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/sms-provider-settings/) properly.{% endif %}
- **Email**. Receive notifications directly in your email inbox. Perfect for users who prefer to stay informed through their email accounts. {% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix contains "paas/") %}To send email notifications, you must configure an [outgoing mail server](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/mail-settings/). Use the system administrator's configuration or set the settings at your level.{% endif %}{% if docsPrefix == null %}To send notifications via email, a system administrator should configure an [outgoing mail server](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/mail-settings/) properly.{% endif %}
- **Slack**. Integrate Slack with ThingsBoard to send notifications as messages to individual users or channels within your Slack workspace. To use this method of notification delivery, you first need to configure the Slack settings in ThingsBoard using [this guide](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/slack-settings/).
- **Microsoft Teams**. Integration of Microsoft Teams with ThingsBoard allows for delivering notifications in the form of messages to specific channels in your Microsoft Teams environment. To use this method a tenant administrator must get **webhook URL** for a needed Microsoft Teams channel using this [guide](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/microsoft-teams-settings/).

## Send notification

To send a notification manually, follow these steps:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-send-notification" showListImageTitles="true" %}

## Inbox

Browse your incoming notifications, mark them as read, or delete them on the "Inbox" tab. By default, only unread notifications are displayed. To view all notifications, switch to the "All" tab in the incoming notifications table.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-inbox" %}

You can also view your incoming notifications by clicking on the bell icon in the top right corner of the screen. The number next to the icon indicates the number of unread notifications. 
Here you can also read the notification, mark it as read, or take action by clicking the action button.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-inbox-bell-icon" %}

## Sent 

In the "Sent" tab, you'll find a list of all the notifications you've sent out, along with their current status.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-sent" %}

To resend a notification, click on the "Notify again" icon in the row of the corresponding notification. You can also delete notifications by clicking the "delete" icon.

{% capture difference %}
**Please note:**
<br>
If you decide to delete an outgoing message, it will also be deleted for all recipients. This only applies to the Web delivery method.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=difference %}

Additionally, you can investigate delivery issues for specific notifications here. If there are delivery issues, the "Status" column will provide relevant information.
This typically occurs when the recipient's email address or phone number is incorrect.

## Recipients

In the "Recipients" tab, you'll find a list of configured notification recipients. You can add, edit existing, and delete notification recipients as needed.
Recipients can be added based on their roles, individual user accounts, predefined groups, etc.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-recipients" %}

For delivering notifications through the mobile app, SMS, and email, basic configuration requirements, which we previously covered in the [Notification delivery methods](#notification-delivery-methods) section, apply.
For delivering notifications through the ThingsBoard platform, Microsoft Teams, and Slack, you'll additionally need to specify the exact destination for your notification at the recipient adding stage.

Depending on the type of recipient you choose, the setup process will vary. Therefore, we will take a closer look at each option individually:

### ThingsBoard platform users

To add recipient from the ThingsBoard user list, follow these steps:

 - Click the "Add recipients" button in the upper right corner of the "Recipients" tab;
 - A new window will pop up. Here, type in the name of the notification recipient(s);
 - Select "Platform users" type;
 - In the "User filter" list, select who you want to send notifications to. It can be a single user, a group of users, tenant administrators, etc.;
 - Click "Add".

A new recipient has been added. Now you can use it to [send a new notification](#send-notification) or create a new [notification rule](#rules).

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-recipients-1" %}

You can also add a new recipient at the stage of manually sending a new notification:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-recipients-2" %}
<br>
There are several user filters that help you to define a recipients:

{% unless docsPrefix contains 'paas/' %}
For *System administrator*:

 * *All users* - all users of the platform. Includes all tenant administrators and all customer users;

 * *Tenant administrators* - set of tenant administrator users that are selected based on the list of tenants or their tenant profiles;

 * *Affected tenant administrators* - The tenant that is affected by the notification trigger event;

 * *System administrators*;

For *Tenant administrator*:
{% endunless %}

 * *All users* - all users of the current tenant. Includes the tenant administrator and all customer users;

 * *Tenant administrators* - all administrators of the current tenant;

 * *User list* - selected users;

{% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix contains "paas/") %}
 * *User group list* - selected user group;
{% endif %}

 * *Customer users* - all users that belong to customers of the current tenant;

{% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix contains "paas/") %}
 * *User role* - selected user role;
{% endif %}

 * *Users of the entity owner* - all users that belong to the entity owner. For example, users of the customer that owns the device or tenant administrators if the device is not assigned to the customer;

 * *Affected user* - The user that is affected by the notification trigger event. For example, the person that is assigned to investigate the alarm event.

### Slack

Send ThingsBoard notifications as Slack messages to a public or private channel, or direct message.

{% capture difference %}
**Please note:**
first, you need to configure the Slack settings in ThingsBoard using [this guide](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/slack-settings/).
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=difference %}

- Click the "Add recipients" button in the upper right corner of the "Recipients" tab;
- A new window will pop up. Here, type in the name of the notification recipient(s);
- Select "Slack" type;
- In the "Slack channel type" field, choose the destination where you'd like your notifications to land: public channel, private channel, or direct message;
- In the additional "Conversation" field, specify the exact conversation or channel in Slack where you want to send notifications;
- Click "Add".

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-recipients-slack" %}

### Microsoft Teams

Send ThingsBoard notifications as messages to your Microsoft Teams channel.

{% capture difference %}
**Please note:**
first, you need to get **webhook URL** for a needed Microsoft Teams channel using this [guide](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/microsoft-teams-settings/).
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=difference %}

- Click the "Add recipients" button in the upper right corner of the "Recipients" tab;

- Select "Microsoft Teams" type;
- Next, you need to specify the *webhook URL* for the Microsoft Teams channel where the notifications will be sent;
- In the "Channel name" field, specify the channel to which you want to send notifications;
- Click "Add".

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-recipients-microsoft-teams" %}

## Templates

The "Templates" tab displays the list of notification templates. Here you can create new templates, duplicate existing ones for easy editing, or delete those you no longer need.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-templates" %}

The template defines the content of the notification and the set of delivery methods to use.
Each template contains a notification subject and message. 
The user may adjust the notification content for specific delivery methods. 
For example, you may use a concise message for SMS and an advanced HTML template for the Email.

Notification subject and message fields support templatization. The list of available templatization parameters depends on the template type. See the available types and parameters below.
Parameter names must be wrapped using `${...}`. For example: `${recipientFirstName}`. 
You may also modify the value of the parameter with one of the sufixes:

 * `upperCase`, for example - `${recipientFirstName:upperCase}`
 * `lowerCase`, for example - `${recipientFirstName:lowerCase}`
 * `capitalize`, for example - `${recipientFirstName:capitalize}`

### Add new template

To add a new template, follow these steps:

- Click the "Add template" button in the upper right corner of the "Templates" tab;
- In the new window, enter the notification template name;
- Select a template type from the drop-down list;
- Next, select one or more delivery methods. In this example, let’s consider the Web delivery method. Click "Next";
- Enter the subject and text of the message;
- Optionally, you can display the icon in the notification and set its color. Also, you can use the action button in the notification; 
- Click "Add".

## Rules

Notification rules allow you to automate the delivery of notifications on a particular trigger event. 
For example, rule automatically sends a notification when a new alarm is created.
The trigger event types are tightly coupled to the notification template types.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-rules" %}

<br>
Let's take a closer look at all rules:

### Alarm

Using the "Alarm" rule the system sends notifications on specific events: alarm is created, acknowledged, cleared, severity updated, or alarm deleted.

To create a new alarm rule, follow these steps:

- Click the "Add rule" button in the upper right corner of the "Rules" tab;
- In the new pop-up window, enter the rule&#39;s name;
- Select trigger - Alarm;
- Then, select pre-made template from the list or [create your own](#templates);
- Build an escalation chain. The escalation chain allows you to configure multiple recipients of the notification. 
The first recipient group will receive the notification immediately. 
Other recipient groups will receive the notification after a configurable delay. 
You may also configure alarm statuses, which will stop the escalation chain. Click "Next";

{% capture difference %}
**Important!**
<br>
If the first recipient of the notification cleared the alarm before the second recipient received the notification, the second and subsequent recipients will not receive the alarm notification.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=difference %}

 - The alarm trigger filter allows you to filter events based on alarm type and severity;
 - You may also select the event types that will trigger notification;
 - Click "Add".

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center-add-rule-alarm" %}

*Default rule*

The default rule 'New alarm' will notify tenant administrators when an alarm is created.

Template subject: `New alarm '${alarmType}'`

Template message: `Severity: ${alarmSeverity}, originator: ${alarmOriginatorEntityType} '${alarmOriginatorName}'`

See [Alarm](#alarm) template for a list of the available template parameters.

### Device activity

Using the "Device activity" rule the system sends notifications when the device becomes active or inactive.

To create a new device activity rule, follow these steps:

- Click the "Add rule" button in the upper right corner of the "Rules" tab;
