## Introduction

The goal of this tutorial is to showcase the fundamental usage of [TBMQ](/docs/mqtt-broker/getting-started-guides/what-is-thingsboard-mqtt-broker/). 
Through this tutorial, you will gain knowledge and proficiency in the following areas:

* Establishing connections between MQTT clients and the broker.
* Publishing MQTT messages.
* Subscribing to topics to receive published messages.
* Configuring authentication and authorization mechanisms for MQTT clients.

For more comprehensive information regarding the architecture of TBMQ, navigate to the following [document](/docs/mqtt-broker/architecture/).
This resource will provide you with detailed insights into the underlying structure and design principles of the broker,
allowing you to develop a deeper understanding of its inner functionalities.

## Installing TBMQ

To obtain detailed instructions on how to install TBMQ on different platforms, we recommend exploring the
[**Installation options**](/docs/mqtt-broker/install/installation-options) documentation. 
This resource will provide you with step-by-step guidance tailored to various deployment scenarios.

Follow the below instructions depending on your system for quick TBMQ installation.

{% capture contenttogglespec %}
Linux & Mac OS%,%linuxmacos%,%templates/mqtt-broker/install/linux-macos/linux-macos.md%br%
Windows%,%windows%,%templates/mqtt-broker/install/windows/windows.md{% endcapture %}

{% include content-toggle.html content-toggle-id="tbmqGettingStartedInstallation" toggle-spec=contenttogglespec %}

Once the installation process is complete for local deployment, you can access TBMQ UI by visiting the following URL: **http://localhost:8083**. 
Wait patiently until the services are up and running. To log in, utilize the following default credentials.

**Username:**
```text
sysadmin@thingsboard.org
```
{: .copy-code}

**Password:**
```text
sysadmin
```
{: .copy-code}

## Configure client authentication & authorization

In order to secure the connection to the broker we should enable Basic or TLS authentication.
In this tutorial, we will focus on the [Basic](/docs/mqtt-broker/security/#basic-authentication) authentication type.
For this, we have set `SECURITY_MQTT_BASIC_ENABLED` environment variable to `true` in the `docker-compose.yml` downloaded in the previous step.

Once Basic authentication is enabled, it is necessary to create MQTT Client Credentials of type `Basic` to authenticate and validate the connecting client.

* Navigate to "Credentials" tab, click "+" in the top right corner of the table.
* Input credentials name. For example, "Getting Started Credentials".
* Input "username" and "password" with chosen values. For example, use `username` and `password` values respectively.
* Authorization rules are set to allow publishing/subscribing to any topic by default.
* Click "Add" to save credentials.

A wider range of authentication methods can be found within the [security guide](/docs/mqtt-broker/security/), offering enhanced options for ensuring secure access.

## Publishing and Subscribing to Topics

Now, let's proceed with publishing messages and subscribing to topics to observe the flow of messages. In this tutorial, 
we will utilize [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) clients for this purpose. 

Please refer to the following links to learn how to [publish messages](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_pub-1.html) to a topic and
[subscribe](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_sub-1.html) to topic filters in order to receive messages.

### Subscribe to topic

To subscribe to the **sensors/temperature** topic and start receiving messages from TBMQ, you can utilize the following command:

```bash
mosquitto_sub -d -h $THINGSBOARD_MQTT_BROKER_HOST_NAME -p 1883 -t sensors/temperature -q 1 -u username -P password -i tbmq_dev
```
{: .copy-code}

**Note**, replace the **$THINGSBOARD_MQTT_BROKER_HOST_NAME** with the correct public IP address or DNS name of the broker, 
`username` and `password` values according to the specified ones in the provisioned credentials.
Kindly replicate the aforementioned process for publishing the message below.

Use the following command for local deployment:
```bash
mosquitto_sub -d -h localhost -p 1883 -t sensors/temperature -q 1 -u username -P password -i tbmq_dev
```
{: .copy-code}

Upon successful establishment of the connection, we can proceed to examine the session information within the UI.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="broker-sessions" %}

### Publish message

To publish a message to TBMQ for the topic **sensors/temperature**, you can utilize the following command:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -d -h $THINGSBOARD_MQTT_BROKER_HOST_NAME -p 1883 -t sensors/temperature -m 32 -q 1 -u username -P password
```
{: .copy-code}

Use the following command for local deployment:
```bash
mosquitto_pub -d -h localhost -p 1883 -t sensors/temperature -m 32 -q 1 -u username -P password
```
{: .copy-code}

### Autogenerated subscribe and publish commands

You may also find the TBMQ browser tool "Check Connectivity" useful for **automatically generating commands** to **subscribe to a topic** and **publish a message**.
This tool uses your host, port, and client credentials data to construct `mosquitto_sub` and `mosquitto_pub` commands. It is available only for the _Basic_ client credentials type.

Please follow these steps to generate commands for "Getting Started Credentials":

1. Open the 'Client Credentials' page from the left-hand menu.
2. Click on row with client credentials "Getting Started Credentials" to open the details.
3. Click on the "Check connectivity" button.
4. In the opened window, select your operating system and install the necessary client tools.
5. You can copy and run the commands, but do not forget to replace "$YOUR_PASSWORD" with the real password.

You can read more about [Check Connectivity](/docs/mqtt-broker/user-guide/ui/mqtt-client-credentials/#check-connectivity) here.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="check-connectivity" %}

### Result

You should receive and observe the published message for the subscribed client.
