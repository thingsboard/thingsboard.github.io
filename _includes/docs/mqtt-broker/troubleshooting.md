## Troubleshooting Tools and Tips

### Kafka Queue: Consumer Group Message Lag 

You can use the log shown below to identify any issues with the processing of messages or other parts of TBMQ infrastructure. 
Since Kafka is used for MQTT message processing and other major parts of the system, such as `client sessions`, `client subscriptions`, `retained messages`, etc., 
you can analyze the overall state of the broker.

TBMQ provides the ability to monitor whether the rate of producing messages to Kafka is faster than the rate of consuming and processing them. 
In such cases, you will experience a growing latency for message processing. 
To enable this functionality, ensure that Kafka consumer-stats are enabled (see the **queue.kafka.consumer-stats** section of the [Configuration properties](/docs/mqtt-broker/install/config/)).

Once Kafka consumer-stats are enabled, logs (see [Troubleshooting](#logs)) about offset lag for consumer groups will be generated.

Here is an example of the log message:

```bash
2022-11-27 02:33:23,625 [kafka-consumer-stats-1-thread-1] INFO  o.t.m.b.q.k.s.TbKafkaConsumerStatsService - [msg-all-consumer-group] Topic partitions with lag: [[topic=[tbmq.msg.all], partition=[2], lag=[5]]].
```

From this message we can see that there are five messages pushed to the `tbmq.msg.all` topic but not yet processed.

In general, the logs have the following structure:

```bash
TIME [STATS_PRINTING_THREAD_NAME] INFO  o.t.m.b.q.k.s.TbKafkaConsumerStatsService - [CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME] Topic partitions with lag: [[topic=[KAFKA_TOPIC], partition=[KAFKA_TOPIC_PARTITION], lag=[LAG]],[topic=[ANOTHER_TOPIC], partition=[], lag=[]],...].
```

Where:
- `CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME` - Name of the consumer group that is processing messages.
- `KAFKA_TOPIC` - Name of the exact Kafka topic.
- `KAFKA_TOPIC_PARTITION` - Number of the topic's partition.
- `LAG` - The amount of unprocessed messages.

**NOTE:** Logs about consumer lag are printed only if there is a lag for this consumer group.

### CPU/Memory Usage

Sometimes, a problem arises due to a lack of resources for a particular service. 
You can view CPU and Memory usage by logging into your `server/container/pod` and executing the `top` Linux command.

For more convenient monitoring, it is better to configure Prometheus and Grafana.

If you see that some services sometimes use 100% of the CPU, you should either scale the service horizontally by creating new nodes 
in the cluster or scale it vertically by increasing the total amount of CPU.

## Logs

### Reading Logs

Regardless of the deployment type, TBMQ logs are stored in the following directory:

```bash
/var/log/thingsboard-mqtt-broker
```

Different deployment tools provide different ways to view logs:

{% capture contenttogglespecdeploymenttype %}
Docker-Compose Deployment%,%docker-compose%,%templates/mqtt-broker/troubleshooting/logs/view-logs/docker-compose-view-logs.md%br%
Kubernetes Deployment%,%kubernetes%,%templates/mqtt-broker/troubleshooting/logs/view-logs/kubernetes-view-logs.md{% endcapture %}

{% include content-toggle.html content-toggle-id="deploymentType" toggle-spec=contenttogglespecdeploymenttype %}

### Enabling Certain Logs

To facilitate troubleshooting, TBMQ allows users to enable or disable logging for specific parts of the system. 
This can be achieved by modifying the **logback.xml** file, which is located in the following directory:

```bash
/usr/share/thingsboard-mqtt-broker/conf
```

Please note that there are separate files for **k8s** and **Docker** deployments.

Here's an example of the **logback.xml** configuration:

```bash
<!DOCTYPE configuration>
<configuration scan="true" scanPeriod="10 seconds">

    <appender name="fileLogAppender"
              class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
        <file>/var/log/thingsboard-mqtt-broker/${TB_SERVICE_ID}/thingsboard-mqtt-broker.log</file>
        <rollingPolicy
                class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeAndTimeBasedRollingPolicy">
            <fileNamePattern>/var/log/thingsboard-mqtt-broker/${TB_SERVICE_ID}/thingsboard-mqtt-broker.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.%i.log</fileNamePattern>
            <maxFileSize>100MB</maxFileSize>
            <maxHistory>30</maxHistory>
            <totalSizeCap>3GB</totalSizeCap>
        </rollingPolicy>
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{ISO8601} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <logger name="org.thingsboard.mqtt.broker.actors.client.service.connect" level="TRACE"/>
    <logger name="org.thingsboard.mqtt.broker.actors.client.service.disconnect.DisconnectServiceImpl" level="INFO"/>
    <logger name="org.thingsboard.mqtt.broker.actors.DefaultTbActorSystem" level="OFF"/>

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="fileLogAppender"/>
    </root>
</configuration>
```

The configuration files contain _loggers_ which are the most useful for troubleshooting, as they allow you to enable or disable logging for a certain class or group of classes. 
In the example given above, the default logging level is set to **INFO**, which means that the logs will contain general information, warnings, and errors. 
However, for the `org.thingsboard.mqtt.broker.actors.client.service.connect` package, the most detailed level of logging is enabled. 
You can also completely disable logs for a part of the system, as is done for the `org.thingsboard.mqtt.broker.actors.DefaultTbActorSystem` class using the **OFF** log-level.

To enable or disable logging for a certain part of the system, you need to add the appropriate `</logger>` configuration and wait for up to 10 seconds.

Different deployment tools have different ways to update logs:

{% capture contenttogglespecdeploymenttype %}
Docker-Compose Deployment%,%docker-compose%,%templates/mqtt-broker/troubleshooting/logs/enable-logs/docker-compose-enable-logs.md%br%
Kubernetes Deployment%,%kubernetes%,%templates/mqtt-broker/troubleshooting/logs/enable-logs/kubernetes-enable-logs.md{% endcapture %}

{% include content-toggle.html content-toggle-id="deploymentType" toggle-spec=contenttogglespecdeploymenttype %}

## Metrics

To enable Prometheus metrics in TBMQ you must: 
- Set the `STATS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`.
- Set the `METRICS_ENDPOINTS_EXPOSE` environment variable to `prometheus` in the configuration file.

The metrics can then be accessed via the following path: `https://<yourhostname>/actuator/prometheus`, and scraped by Prometheus (authentication is not required).

## Prometheus metrics

The Spring Actuator in TBMQ can expose some internal state metrics through Prometheus.

Here is a list of the metrics that TBMQ pushes to Prometheus:
