TBMQ HTTP Integration provides a simple and efficient way to forward MQTT messages from devices to an external system using the HTTP protocol. 
It acts as a **bridge** between TBMQ and external applications, ensuring seamless and reliable data exchange. 

## Data Flow Overview

TBMQ HTTP Integration enables forwarding MQTT messages to an external HTTP service:  

1. **Device (client) publishes an MQTT message** to a topic that matches the Integration's **Topic Filters**.  
2. **TBMQ broker receives the message** and forwards to TBMQ Integration Executor.  
3. **TBMQ Integration Executor processes the message**, formats it as an HTTP request, and forwards it to the external service.  
4. **External service receives the request** and processes the data accordingly.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the integration, ensure the following:

- A running **[TBMQ](/docs/mqtt-broker/install/installation-options/)** instance.  
- An external service ready to receive HTTP requests (e.g., **[ThingsBoard Cloud](/docs/paas/getting-started-guides/what-is-thingsboard-cloud/)**).  
- A client capable of publishing MQTT messages (e.g., **[TBMQ WebSocket Client](/docs/mqtt-broker/user-guide/ui/websocket-client/)**).  

## Create ThingsBoard Integration

In this tutorial, we use **ThingsBoard** as the external service receiving HTTP requests from TBMQ. However, any other HTTP-compatible service can be used.

Follow the official **[ThingsBoard HTTP Integration Guide](/docs/paas/user-guide/integrations/http/)** to create an integration on ThingsBoard Cloud.

Once the HTTP Integration is created:

1. Open the **details page** and enable **debug mode** to verify data reception.  
2. **Copy the HTTP endpoint URL**, as this will be needed in the next step.

## Create TBMQ HTTP Integration

1. Go to the **Integrations** page and click the "+" button to create a new integration.
2. Select **HTTP** as the integration type and click **Next**.
3. On the **Topic Filters** page click **Next** to subscribe to the default topic `tbmq/#`.
4. In the **Configuration** step, paste the **Endpoint URL** from the ThingsBoard Integration.
5. Open **Advanced settings** and set **Payload content type** to `JSON`.
6. Click **Add** to save the integration.

> You can test the connectivity to the configured HTTP endpoint by sending a HEAD request using the 'Check connection' button.

### Topic Filters

{% include templates/mqtt-broker/user-guide/integrations/topic-filters.md %}

### Configuration

|**Field**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|-
| **Send only message payload** | If enabled, the incoming message's payload is forwarded as is. If disabled, a JSON object with the payload and other properties is sent. |
| **Endpoint URL** | The external service URL where HTTP requests are sent. |
| **Request Method** | Defines how the request is made. Supported methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`. |
| **Credentials** | Supported authentication options: |
| | **Anonymous** – No authentication. |
| | **Basic Authentication** – Uses `Username` and `Password` for authentication. |
| | **PEM-based authentication** – Uses PEM certificate to authenticate. |
| **Headers** | A collection of key-value pairs added to the HTTP request headers. |
| **Payload Content Type** | Defines the format of the request body. Supported: `JSON`, `Text`, `Binary (Base64)`. |
| **Send as binary on parsing error** | If enabled, messages with a failed `JSON` or `Text` parsing attempt will be sent as a binary payload. If disabled, failed messages will not be sent. |
| **Read Timeout** | Maximum time the request waits for a response before timing out. |
| **Max Parallel Requests** | Limits the number of concurrent HTTP requests. |
| **Max Response Size** | Defines the maximum allowed size for incoming responses. |
| **Metadata** | Custom metadata that can be used for additional processing. |

### Events

{% include templates/mqtt-broker/user-guide/integrations/events.md %}

## Sending an Uplink Message

To send a message, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **WebSocket Client** page.
2. Select 'WebSocket Default Connection' or any other available working connection, then click **Connect**. Make sure the 'Connection status' is shown as `Connected`.
3. Set the 'Topic' field to `tbmq/http-integration` to match the Integration's 'Topic Filter' `tbmq/#`.
4. Click the **Send** icon to publish the message. 
5. If successfull, the message should appear in the 'Messages' table.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="send-uplink-message" %}

Once the message is published:

1. In the **ThingsBoard Cloud** open the HTTP Integration details.
2. Go to the **Events** tab.
3. If the setup is correct, you should see an event with the status **'OK'** and a message payload similar to:

```json
{
    "payload": {
        "temperature": 25
    },
    "topicName": "tbmq/http-integration",
    "clientId": "tbmq_7QUvZzow",
    "eventType": "PUBLISH_MSG",
    "qos": 1,
    "retain": false,
    "tbmqIeNode": "tbmq_ie_node",
    "tbmqNode": "tbmq_node",
    "ts": 1742553324248,
    "props": {},
    "metadata": {
        "integrationName": "HTTP integration"
    }
}
```

Message description:

- **payload**: Content of the MQTT message.
- **topicName**: The MQTT topic to which the message was published.
- **clientId**: The ID of the MQTT client that published the message.
- **eventType**: Type of MQTT event, here it's a published message (the only supported type for now).
- **qos**: Quality of Service level used for the incoming message.
- **retain**: Indicates if the message is a retained MQTT message.
- **tbmqIeNode**: Node ID of the Integration Executor service that handled the message.
- **tbmqNode**: Node ID of the TBMQ broker that received the message.
- **ts**: Timestamp (in milliseconds) when the message was received.
- **props**: MQTT 5.0 user properties or other MQTT properties.
- **metadata**: Additional metadata added from integration configuration, e.g., the name of the integration that handled the message, added by default.
