Basic authentication remains one of the most common methods for authenticating MQTT clients due to its simplicity and native support in the MQTT protocol.
It is often used in scenarios where clients are provisioned with predefined credentials — such as IoT devices connecting to private networks, 
internal system integrations, or deployments with straightforward access control requirements. 
When combined with secure transport (TLS), it provides a reliable and widely adopted authentication option for many MQTT use cases.

### Basic authentication overview

Basic authentication allows MQTT clients to authenticate using credentials sent in the `CONNECT` packet — such as clientId, username, and password.
TBMQ uses these credentials to generate a unique `credentialsId` and match against the stored [MQTT client credential](/docs/mqtt-broker/user-guide/ui/mqtt-client-credentials/) records using flexible matching strategies.
To optimize authentication performance, TBMQ maintains credentials in Redis for fast lookups, while PostgreSQL ensures reliable persistence.
The following sections explain provider configuration, credential matching, `credentialsId` generation, and how authorization is applied after successful authentication.

### Credentials matching

The following are the **possible combinations** of `Basic` credentials matchers:
- **clientId** - checks if the connecting client has specified clientId.
- **username** - checks if the connecting client has specified a username.
- **clientId and username** - checks if the connecting client has specified both clientId and username.
- **username and password** - checks if the connecting client has specified both username and password.
- **clientId and password** - checks if the connecting client has specified both clientId and password.
- **clientId, username and password** - checks if the connecting client has specified clientId, username, and password.

### Credentials ID

When a client connects, the combination of the username, password, and clientId from the `CONNECT` packet is matched with the persisted credentials to authenticate the client.
The matching is based on the auto-generated `credentialsId` field from the MQTT client credentials. 

The `credentialsId` is generated as follows:

- credentialsId = `username|$CLIENT_USERNAME` when only username is present;
- credentialsId = `client_id|$CLIENT_ID` when only client ID is present;
- credentialsId = `mixed|$CLIENT_USERNAME|$CLIENT_ID` when both username and client ID are present.

Where `$CLIENT_USERNAME` refers to the specified username, `$CLIENT_ID` refers to the specified client ID from the `CONNECT` packet.

### Authorization

After the user has been authenticated, it is possible to restrict the client's access to topics they can publish or subscribe to.

To provide flexible control over authorization rules, TBMQ uses regular expressions. 

For example, to **allow clients to publish or subscribe to all topics** that begin with **city/**, an authorization rule should be created with the value **city/.***.

For the Basic type, authorization is configured through the **pubAuthRulePatterns** and **subAuthRulePatterns** of the corresponding MQTT client credentials. 
Therefore, for each Basic MQTT client credential, you can configure the authorization rules for the topics that these clients can access. 

The **pubAuthRulePatterns** and **subAuthRulePatterns** are based on regular expression syntax. For example,
```
{
    "pubAuthRulePatterns": ["country/.*"],
    "subAuthRulePatterns": ["city/.*"]
}
```
{: .copy-code}
The following configuration allows clients to publish messages to topics that start with **country/** and subscribe to topics that start with **city/**.

### MQTT Example based on Client ID, Username and Password

For this option, you should populate Client ID, Username and Password in the MQTT client credential. MQTT clients will be able to connect if they specify correct combination of client ID, username and password.

Let's review a simple command to publish message using MQTT client ID, username and password to the TBMQ. The command is using plain MQTT without TLS:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -d -q 1 -h "YOUR_TBMQ_HOST" -p "1883" -t "sensors/temperature" -i "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" -u "YOUR_CLIENT_USERNAME" -P "YOUR_CLIENT_PASSWORD" -m {"temperature":25}
```
{: .copy-code}

where:

* **YOUR_TBMQ_HOST** is the host of your TBMQ instance;
* **YOUR_CLIENT_ID** is your client id;
* **YOUR_CLIENT_USERNAME**, **YOUR_CLIENT_PASSWORD** is your client username and password.

### MQTTS Example based on Client ID, Username and Password

One-way SSL authentication is a standard authentication mode, where your client device verifies the identity of a server using server certificate.
Follow the [MQTT over SSL](/docs/mqtt-broker/security/mqtts/) guide to provision server certificate for your own TBMQ instance.

Let's review a simple command to publish message using MQTT client ID, username and password to the TBMQ. The command is using MQTTS:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -d -q 1 --cafile YOUR_PEM_FILE -h "YOUR_TBMQ_HOST" -p 8883 -t "sensors/temperature" -i "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" -u "YOUR_CLIENT_USERNAME" -P "YOUR_CLIENT_PASSWORD" -m {"temperature":25}
```
{: .copy-code}

where:

* **YOUR_PEM_FILE** is your CA file;
* **YOUR_TBMQ_HOST** is the host of your TBMQ instance;
* **YOUR_CLIENT_ID** is your client id;
* **YOUR_CLIENT_USERNAME**, **YOUR_CLIENT_PASSWORD** is your client username and password.
