### Managing Provider

You can check the authentication provider status, enable or disable it directly from the TBMQ user interface, making it easy to manage authentication behavior without modifying configuration files or restarting the broker.

* On the **Home** page, in the **Broker Settings** card, you’ll find quick-toggle buttons for each available authentication provider.
Click the button next to the desired provider to enable or disable it.
* On the **Authentication Providers** page, you have more control and visibility:
  * You can enable or disable a provider directly from the table by clicking the Switch button in the corresponding row. 
  * For more detailed management, click on a provider to open its details page, where you can change the status or other parameters.
