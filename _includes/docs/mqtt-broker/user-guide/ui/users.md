TBMQ presently offers a single tier of user roles, namely 'Administrator'. Administrators are authorized to create, modify, and remove user accounts.

User management can be performed through TBMQ's Web UI or [REST API](/docs/mqtt-broker/user-management/), which enables users to modify user details.
