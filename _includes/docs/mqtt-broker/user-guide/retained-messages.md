Retained Messages is an MQTT feature that allows storing the "last known good" message for a 
particular topic on the broker and delivering the message to a client whenever the client subscribes to a matching topic.

There are a few important notes to mention regarding retained messages:
* Only **one message** can be stored on the broker **per topic**.
* The **next message** published on the same topic will **replace the previous one**.
* The **message with an empty payload** published on the same topic will **clear** it entirely from that topic.
* The subscribers for the topic will receive **only the last message** if available.

## Retained Messages usage

When a client subscribes to a topic, it typically only receives messages published after it has subscribed. 
However, with retained messages, the broker stores the last message sent to that topic, ensuring that any new subscriber immediately receives the latest retained message, 
even if it was published before the subscription was made.

When to use Retained Messages:

* **Initial state information**: if your subscribers need to know the last known value of a topic upon connection, retained messages are ideal. 
For instance, in a temperature monitoring system, new subscribers will receive the last reported temperature right away, without waiting for the next update.
* **Critical configuration or status updates**: for topics that carry important configuration data or device status updates, 
retained messages ensure that even newly connected devices or clients receive the current status immediately. 
For example, a retained message can be used to inform clients of the system’s operational state, such as "Device Online" or "Service in Maintenance."
* **Last Will and Testament (LWT) notifications**: retained messages work well in conjunction with LWT messages. 
For instance, you can use a retained message to announce the current availability of a device, and if the device disconnects unexpectedly, the LWT can update this status accordingly.
* **Persistent commands or instructions**: if you publish control commands or instructions that need to be retained until a client receives them (e.g., turning on a device), 
using retained messages ensures that the command persists until a subscriber is ready to process it.

When to avoid Retained Messages:

* **Frequent real-time updates**: if your topic provides frequent real-time data (like sensor readings that are updated every second), 
using retained messages may not add significant value and could create unnecessary overhead, as the latest data will naturally be sent to subscribers.
* **Sensitive or temporary data**: if the messages contain temporary or sensitive information that shouldn’t persist for new subscribers 
(e.g., one-time notifications or alerts), retained messages should be avoided.

By leveraging retained messages effectively, you can ensure that new subscribers always receive the latest critical information without waiting, 
improving the overall responsiveness and user experience in your MQTT setup.

## Publish Retained Message

In MQTT, the retained message refers to a regular publish message with the **retained flag** set to _true_.
Let's consider a simple command using `mosquitto_pub` to publish a retained message. 

```shell
mosquitto_pub -d -h "YOUR_MQTT_BROKER_HOST" -p 1883 -D PUBLISH user-property hello world -q 1 -t demo/topic -V mqttv5 -m "Hello world" -r
```
{: .copy-code}

**Note:** do not forget to put your hostname instead of `YOUR_MQTT_BROKER_HOST`. 
Make sure authentications are disabled. Otherwise, adjust the commands in this guide appropriately.

Utilize the following command to connect to a locally deployed TBMQ using default credentials:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -d -h "localhost" -p 1883 -D PUBLISH user-property hello world -q 1 -t demo/topic -V mqttv5 -m "Hello world" -r -u tbmq_websockets_username
```
{: .copy-code}

## Payload, User Properties

To access and view the payload and user properties of the last message for a specific topic on the WEB UI Retained Messages page, please follow these steps:

1. Open page Retained Messages.
2. Optionally, use the filter to find the retained message by topic, payload, or QoS.
3. To view the payload of a retained message, click on the icon `{}`. 
4. To view the User Properties of retained message click on the icon `[]`. Please note that if the button is disabled, the retained message does not have any user properties.

## Deleting Retained Message

Deleting a retained message is a straightforward process. To remove a previous retained message, you can send a new retained message with a `zero-byte payload` to the 
specific topic associated with the retained message you want to delete. Subsequently, any new subscribers to that topic will no longer receive the previously retained message.

To delete a retained message for the topic `demo/topic`, you can use the following command, specifying the `-n` flag with a zero-byte payload:

```shell
mosquitto_pub -d -h "YOUR_MQTT_BROKER_HOST" -p 1883 -q 1 -t demo/topic -n -r
```
{: .copy-code}

For local deployment using default credentials:
```shell
mosquitto_pub -d -h "localhost" -p 1883 -q 1 -t demo/topic -n -r -u tbmq_websockets_username
```
{: .copy-code}

To delete retained messages using the WEB UI of TBMQ, you have two options based on the number of messages you want to delete:
1. **Deleting a Single Retained Message.** Click on the icon 'Delete retained message' and confirm action.
2. **Deleting Multiple Retained Messages:** 
  * Select messages you want to delete.
  * Click on the 'Delete retained messages' button in the top right corner and confirm the action when prompted.

## Clearing Empty Retained Message Nodes

Retained messages in the broker are stored in the memory using the [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) data structure, 
which is known for its efficient searching capabilities.
The Trie (also called a prefix tree) is a tree-based data structure that allows for quick retrieval of information based on a key or a sequence of characters.

The Trie organizes the topic names in a hierarchical manner, where each node represents a topic level from the topic name.
By using the Trie data structure, the broker can quickly locate and retrieve retained messages based on the topic filter provided by a subscribing client. 
This ensures that clients receive the retained messages they are interested in without significant delays, contributing to improved performance and responsiveness of the broker.

When a retained message is deleted, the broker removes the message payload from its memory and marks the node as empty.
Over time, if many retained messages are deleted, there may be many empty nodes left in the broker's memory.
These empty nodes can cause inefficiencies and waste memory resources.

Clearing empty retained message nodes frees up memory resources and can improve the performance of the broker, 
as it can process MQTT messages more quickly when there are fewer empty nodes to search through.

To Clear empty retained message nodes click on the button 'Clear empty retained messages nodes' in the top right corner and confirm action.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="clear-empty-retained-messages" %}

Additionally, the broker is configured to clear empty retained message nodes by a scheduler. This is controlled by the following environment variables:
`MQTT_RETAIN_MSG_TRIE_CLEAR_NODES_CRON` and `MQTT_RETAIN_MSG_TRIE_CLEAR_NODES_ZONE`.
