TBMQ API consists of two main parts: MQTT client API and server-side API.

MQTT client API can be reviewed with the following pages:

* [**MQTT Pub**](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_pub-1.html) - publish messages.
* [**MQTT Sub**](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_sub-1.html) - subscribe to topics.

Server-side API is available as REST API:

* [**Administration REST API**](/docs/mqtt-broker/rest-api) - The server-side core APIs.
* [**Admin User Management**](/docs/mqtt-broker/user-management/) - The server-side APIs for User management.
* [**MQTT Client Credentials Management**](/docs/mqtt-broker/mqtt-client-credentials-management/) - The server-side APIs for MQTT client credentials management.
* [**Application Shared Subscriptions Management**](/docs/mqtt-broker/application-shared-subscription/) - The server-side APIs for Application Shared Subscriptions management.

These APIs offer a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities to manage and interact with TBMQ, 
empowering users to administer, control, and customize their MQTT-based applications effectively.
