Welcome! This guide will walk you through building and setting up a custom {{appPrefix}} mobile application from scratch for your own instance of the {{appPrefix}} platform.

## Prerequisites

{% if docsPrefix == "pe/" or docsPrefix == "paas/" or docsPrefix == "paas/eu/" %}
- You will need to have access to ThingsBoard Professional Edition. The easiest way is to use [ThingsBoard Cloud](https://thingsboard.io/installations/choose-region/){:target="_blank"} server.
The alternative option is to install ThingsBoard PE using [installation guide](/docs/user-guide/install/pe/installation-options/){:target="_blank"}.
{% else %}  
- You will need to have access to ThingsBoard. The easiest way is to use [Live Demo](https://demo.thingsboard.io/signup){:target="_blank"}. 
The alternative option is to install ThingsBoard using [installation guide](/docs/user-guide/install/installation-options/){:target="_blank"}.
{% endif %}

> **Note**: The mobile app requires {{appPrefix}} platform version **3.9.0** or later to work properly.

- Prepare the environment for building your {{appPrefix}} mobile application. Install the Flutter SDK (version 2.12.0 or later) by following [these instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install){:target="_blank"}.
- For the best development experience and performance, we also recommend configuring your IDE (such as Visual Studio Code) using [these guidelines](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor){:target="_blank"}.
- You can also check out the documentation on how to [write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive){:target="_blank"}.

## Step 1: Create a bundle in the Mobile center

The [Mobile center](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}mobile-center/mobile-center/){:target="_blank"} is your control hub for creating, configuring, and managing mobile applications for your {{appPrefix}} instance. 
It allows you to quickly launch a custom {{appPrefix}} mobile application tailored to your platform.

<b><font size="4">Create a new bundle</font></b>

A [bundle](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}mobile-center/mobile-center/#bundle){:target="_blank"} contains both your Android and/or iOS app configurations — including [OAuth 2.0](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/oauth-2-support/){:target="_blank"} settings {% if docsPrefix == null %}and [layout](/docs/mobile-center/mobile-center/#layout){:target="_blank"} preferences{% endif %}{% if docsPrefix == "pe/" or docsPrefix == "paas/" or docsPrefix == "paas/eu/" %}, [layout](/docs/pe/mobile-center/mobile-center/#layout){:target="_blank"} preferences, and [self registration](/docs/pe/mobile-center/mobile-center/#self-registration){:target="_blank"} options{% endif %} — all in one place for easier setup.

Add a new bundle: 
- Navigate to the "**Mobile center**" page.
- On the "**Bundle**" tab, click the "**+ Add bundle**" button in the upper-right corner of the window. 

The bundle creation window will open.

{% assign addNewBundleCE = '

{% include images-gallery.liquid imageCollection=addNewBundlePE %}
{% else %}  
{% include images-gallery.liquid imageCollection=addNewBundleCE %}
{% endif %}

<br><b><font size="4">Basic settings</font></b>

Enter the **bundle name** and choose the **mobile app platform(s)** — **Android** or **iOS** — then click "**Create new**" in the corresponding section and proceed with the next steps:

- Enter the **application package** name.
- An **Application Secret** will be generated automatically (you can also set your own).
- Set the **Published** application status – application is ready for release.
- (Optional) Specify minimum and latest app versions + release notes.
- Add **store information**:
    - **Android**: **Google Play Store link** and **SHA256 certificate fingerprints**.
    - **iOS**: **App Store link** and **App ID**.
- Click "**Add**" to save and continue.

Then click "**Next**".

{% capture run_tip %}
**Tip:** The first time you run on a physical device, it can take a while to load.
Afterward, you can use hot reload for quick updates.

**Save** also performs a hot reload if the app is running.
When running an app directly from the console using `flutter run`, enter `r` to perform hot reload.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=run_tip %}

## Step 2. [Optional] Configure push notifications

Our system leverages Firebase to send notifications from ThingsBoard instance directly to mobile application.
This setup requires each platform tenant to configure Firebase specifically for their account to begin the distribution of notifications to their mobile app.

<br><font size="5">Step 2.1 Create Firebase project</font>

Next, we will walk through step-by-step how to create a Firebase project, and within it, we will generate a private key. This key is required for securely connecting your ThingsBoard instance to Firebase services. 

{% capture difference %}
**Please note:**
for ThingsBoard CE, only the system administrator can configure mobile settings. For ThingsBoard PE - the tenant can use the system administrator&#39;s configuration or specify their own.

<br><font size="5">Step 2.3 Check project configuration</font>

After successfully completing these steps, make sure that your project contains the following file:

- If your ThingsBoard mobile application is intended for iOS:

```text
ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
```

- If your ThingsBoard mobile application is intended for Android:

```text
android/app/google-services.json
```

## Troubleshooting

If you're running into issues while building or running your mobile application, here's a detailed guide to help you resolve the most common problems.

### App won&#39;t build

{{appPrefix}} mobile app supports specific Flutter versions. Our release isn&#39;t always aligned with Flutter&#39;s official releases, so a newer Flutter version may not yet be compatible.

> Always use the exact Flutter version specified for your app version. Otherwise, builds might fail or behave unexpectedly.

<b><font size="4">How to check the required Flutter version?</font></b>

{% if docsPrefix == null %}
1. Check the release notes at the following [link](https://github.com/thingsboard/flutter_thingsboard_app/releases){:target="_blank"}.
{% endif %}
{% if docsPrefix == "pe/" or docsPrefix == "paas/" or docsPrefix == "paas/eu/" %}
1. Check the release notes at the following [link](https://github.com/thingsboard/flutter_thingsboard_pe_app/releases){:target="_blank"}.
{% endif %}

Example:

<object width="70%" data="/images/mobile/getting-started/check-flutter-version.png"></object>

<br>

**2. Check the `.fvmrc` file in the project root:**

You&#39;ll find a file like this:

```json
{
  "flutter": "3.24.4"
}
```

That means we&#39;re currently using Flutter 3.24.4.

<br><b><font size="4">Installing the correct flutter version</font></b>

**Option 1**: Use [FVM](https://fvm.app/){:target="_blank"} (Flutter version manager) **[Recommended]**

**What is FVM?**

FVM helps you manage multiple Flutter versions across projects. It lets you manage multiple versions of Flutter and easily switch between them per project. 
This is super useful when testing new Flutter releases or contributing to different projects.

To install FVM follow the [official installation guide](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation){:target="_blank"}.

Usage: Use Flutter commands prefixed with `fvm`, like this:

Examples:

```bash
fvm flutter run
fvm flutter build apk
```

**Option 2**: Manually set the global Flutter version **[Not recommended]**

If you only work on one project, you can manually set the global Flutter version:

```bash
cd ~/dev/flutter
git checkout 3.24.4
```

### Warning "Push notifications are not configured"

If you see a warning like:

> "**Push notifications are not configured**"

This usually means Firebase wasn&#39;t set up correctly.

**Fix:**

> **Note:** You must have completed [Step 2](/docs/mobile/getting-started/#step-2-optional-configure-push-notifications){:target="_blank"} in the setup guide first.

<b>1.</b> Delete the file: `lib/firebase_options.dart`
<br><b>2.</b> Re-run the FlutterFire CLI:

```bash
flutterfire configure
```
{:.copy-code}

<b>3.</b> Ensure the `firebase_options.dart` file is regenerated and contains configuration for Android and iOS, or both.

### Dashboard not loads

The mobile app doesn&#39;t really load the dashboard itself — the ThingsBoard platform handles all the real loading.
The mobile app simply opens a WebView, but the app and the platform must be able to communicate with each other.

**First, check the log**. Look for this log message:

```bash
Invoked tbMobileReadyHandler
```

- **If it&#39;s missing, the platform isn&#39;t signaling the app that it&#39;s ready:** In that case, open an issue in the [ThingsBoard platform repository](https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard){:target="_blank"}.

- **If you see the log but the dashboard still won&#39;t load:**{% if docsPrefix == null %}In that case, open an issue in the [CE mobile repository](https://github.com/thingsboard/flutter_thingsboard_app/issues){:target="_blank"}.{% endif %}{% if docsPrefix == "pe/" or docsPrefix == "paas/" or docsPrefix == "paas/eu/" %}In that case, open an issue in the [PE mobile repository](https://github.com/thingsboard/flutter_thingsboard_pe_app/issues){:target="_blank"}.{% endif %}

*Be as detailed as possible and include credentials to your instance privately via ThingsBoard Support (never post publicly).*

### Can&#39;t sign in?

[Check the compatibility matrix](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}/mobile/){:target="_blank"} between your platform and mobile app versions. Mismatches here are the most common cause of sign-in issues.

If versions are aligned and you&#39;re still stuck:
{% if docsPrefix == null %}
- [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/thingsboard/flutter_thingsboard_app/issues){:target="_blank"}.
{% endif %}
{% if docsPrefix == "pe/" or docsPrefix == "paas/" or docsPrefix == "paas/eu/" %}
- [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/thingsboard/flutter_thingsboard_pe_app/issues){:target="_blank"}.
{% endif %}
- Include:
  - Platform version 
  - Mobile app version 
  - Logs/screenshots 
  - Device details (OS, version)

There&#39;s a compatibility matrix between the TB platform and mobile app versions: [Check it here](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}/mobile/){:target="_blank"}

It&#39;s the most common reason for sign-in issues.

If your versions are aligned and it still doesn&#39;t work — [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/thingsboard/flutter_thingsboard_app/issues){:target="_blank"} and include all the relevant details.

### Anything else?

These are the most frequent issues — but if you&#39;re facing something new:

{% if docsPrefix == null %}
[Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/thingsboard/flutter_thingsboard_app/issues){:target="_blank"}. Include all the context you can (screenshots, logs, versions, platform setup, etc.)
{% endif %}
{% if docsPrefix == "pe/" or docsPrefix == "paas/" or docsPrefix == "paas/eu/" %}
[Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/thingsboard/flutter_thingsboard_pe_app/issues){:target="_blank"}. Include all the context you can (screenshots, logs, versions, platform setup, etc.)
{% endif %}
