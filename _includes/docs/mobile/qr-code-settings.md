This guide provides instructions on how to configure a custom mobile application to launch directly from a [QR code scan](/docs/{{peDocsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/mobile-qr-code/) using your phone's camera.

In application version 1.7.0+, we have made QR code settings configuration much easier by using configuration file.

{% capture pre_1_7_0_link %} 
Important Notice: Please use [this guide](/docs/{{peDocsPrefix}}mobile/qr-code-settings-before-v1.7/) for pre 1.7.x qr code configuration

## Platform Configuration

### iOS Application Setup

Navigate to **Mobile Center → Applications → Your custom iOS app** in the ThingsBoard platform.

#### App Site Association ID

Provide the **App Site Association ID** in your app store info settings:

The App Site Association ID consists of two parts separated by a dot:

**1. App Store Team ID**
- Get your Team ID from [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account)
- Look for it in the "Membership details" block

**2. App Bundle ID**
- Must be the same as the Application package in your app settings
- This is your app's unique identifier

### Android Application Setup

Navigate to **Mobile Center → Applications → Your custom Android app** in the ThingsBoard platform.

#### SHA-256 Fingerprint

Provide the **SHA-256 fingerprint** of your app's signing key:

**For Google Play distributed apps:**
Use the SHA-256 certificate fingerprint located in your Google Play Console under:
**Release → Setup → App Integrity → App Signing tab**

**For locally distributed apps:**
