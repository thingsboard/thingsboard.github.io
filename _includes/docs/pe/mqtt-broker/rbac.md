**TBMQ Professional Edition** includes support for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

With RBAC, you grant permissions to users according to their role in the organization. This streamlines authorization, strengthens security by limiting access.

At the moment, you can assign one of two predefined roles when creating a user (choose it from the **Role** dropdown):

* **Administrator**
Administrators have unrestricted access to all TBMQ features and resources.

* **Viewer**
Viewers have read-only access to all TBMQ data and configuration.
