**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** in TBMQ PE provides a structured and secure way to manage access to broker features 
and operations through predefined user roles. 
This system enables administrators to grant appropriate permissions to users based on their role within the organization.

### Available Roles

TBMQ PE introduces two predefined user roles:

* **Admin**: Full access to all broker features.
* **Viewer**: Read-only access to all broker data â€” without the ability to perform changes or administrative actions.

### Benefits

* **Enhanced security**: Limit access to sensitive broker features based on user responsibilities.
* **Simplified administration**: Easily assign predefined roles to users without managing granular permissions.
* **Compliance and auditing**: Support best practices in access control by separating duties between administrative and observability roles.

### Use Cases

* Assign the **Admin** role to team members responsible for configuring or maintaining the broker environment.
* Grant the **Viewer** role to operations or monitoring personnel who need visibility into system health and client behavior without risking configuration changes.
