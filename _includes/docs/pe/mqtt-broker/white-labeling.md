## Overview

White labeling lets you tailor your TBMQ instance to match your brand and preferences - especially useful for companies delivering IoT solutions to their customers.

Set your company or product name, upload your logo, choose color palettes.

## Customize TBMQ web interface

To configure your company or product **logo** and **color scheme**, go to the "White labeling" page.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="white-labeling-default" %}

In the "General" tab you can set or change the following options:

 - Application title - you can specify a custom page title, which is displayed in the browser tab;
 - Favicon (website icon) - you can change the default website icon to your own;
 - Logo - you can change the standard logo in the upper left corner to your company logo; 
 - Logo height - you can resize the logo;

 - White labeling allows you to customize the color theme by adjusting the primary and accent palettes to match your desired UI design.

    - Primary palette - you can customize the background color and font color by choosing one of the suggested UI design options or customizing an existing one;
    - Accent palette - you can customize the color for some elements, for example, for a toggle;

 - Advanced CSS - you can stylize any elements of the TBMQ user interface as you wish. We will talk more about this functionality [below](#advanced-css);
 - Show/hide platform name and version - by checking this option, the name of the platform and its current version will be displayed in the lower left corner.

### Advanced CSS

Using CSS, you can stylize any elements of the TBMQ user interface as you wish. Such elements can be background, icons, fonts, etc.

To use CSS in your UI design, do the following:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="advanced-css" showListImageTitles="true" %}

CSS code example for customize icons color, scroll color and active button:

```css
/*icon color*/

.mat-icon.notranslate.ng-star-inserted {
    fill: #a60062;
    color: #a60062;
}

/*scroll color*/

mat-toolbar::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb,
div::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb,
ng-component::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
    background-color: #c526a5 !important;
    background-image: linear-gradient(#e72c83, #a742c6);
    border-radius: 200px/300px !important;
    border: 0.1rem linear-gradient(#e72c83, #a742c6);
}

/*active button color*/

.mat-mdc-button.mat-mdc-button-base.tb-active{
    color: #ffffff;

```

Using the functionality described in this documentation, you can customize the appearance of the TBMQ UI according to your preferences.

## Customize the login page

On the "Login" tab, you can configure the TBMQ **login page**.

- Enter the registered domain name, or refer to [this documentation](/docs/pe/mqtt-broker/security/domains/#domain-registration){:target="_blank"} to learn how to register a new domain;
- It is recommended to prevent usage of hostnames from headers of the request;
- Enter a custom application title;
- Replace the default website icon and logo with your own;
- Define the primary and accent color palettes;
- Set the page background color.

Once done, save the changes.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="customize-login-page" %}

Now, use your custom domain name to access the TBMQ web interface login page and verify the result of your configuration.
