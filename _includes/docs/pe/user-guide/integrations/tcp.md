TCP Integration allows to stream data from devices which use a TCP transport protocol to ThingsBoard and converts payloads of these devices into the ThingsBoard format.

{% capture difference %}
**Please note** TCP Integration can be started only as [remote Integration](/docs/{{peDocsPrefix}}user-guide/integrations/remote-integrations){:target="_blank"}. It could be started on the same machine, where TB instance is running, or you can start in on another machine, that has access over the network to the TB instance.

## Prerequisites

In this tutorial, we will use:

{% if docsPrefix == "pe/" %}
 - The instance of [ThingsBoard Professional Edition](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/install/pe/installation-options/){:target="_blank"} installed locally;
{% endif %}
{% if docsPrefix == "paas/" %}
 - ThingsBoard Professional Edition instance â€” [thingsboard.cloud](https://thingsboard.cloud){:target="_blank"};
{% endif %}
 - TCP Integration, running externally and connected to the cloud ThingsBoard PE instance;
 - **echo** command which intended to display a line of text, and will redirect it's output to **netcat** (**nc**) utility;
 - **netcat** (**nc**) utility to establish TCP connections, receive data from there and transfer them;    

Let's assume that we have a sensor which is sending current temperature and humidity readings.
Our sensor device **SN-002** publishes it's temperature and humidity readings to TCP Integration on **10560** port to the machine where TCP Integration is running.

For demo purposes we assume that our device is smart enough to send data in 3 different payload types:

You can select payload type based on your device capabilities and business cases:

{% capture threepayloadtypes %}
Text payload<br>%,%text%,%templates/integration/tcp/text-payload-type-tcp.md%br%
JSON payload<br>%,%json%,%templates/integration/tcp/json-payload-type-tcp.md%br%
Binary payload<br>%,%binary%,%templates/integration/tcp/binary-payload-type-tcp.md{% endcapture %}

{% include content-toggle.liquid content-toggle-id="threepayloadtypes" toggle-spec=threepayloadtypes %} 

{% capture difference %}
**Please note**
<br>
On the machine, where TCP Integration is running, port **10560** must be opened for incoming connections - **nc** utility must be able to connect to TCP socket. In case you are running it locally, it should be fine without any additional changes.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=difference %}

## Add TCP integration

**1. Basic settings**.

Go to the "**Integrations**" page of the "**Integrations center**" section. Click "plus" button to start adding new integration. Select type "**TCP**" integration and click "**Next**";

![image](/images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-integration-setup-1-pe.png)

<br>
**2. Uplink data converter**. 

An uplink converter that is a script for parsing and transforming the data received by TCP integration to a format that ThingsBoard can consume.
**deviceName** and **deviceType** are required, while **attributes** and **telemetry** are optional. **attributes** and **telemetry** are flat key-value objects. Nested objects are not supported.

Choose device payload type to for decoder configuration:

{% capture tcpuplinkdecoderconfiguration %}
Text payload<br>%,%text%,%templates/integration/tcp/uplink-decoder-text-payload-tcp.md%br%
JSON payload<br>%,%json%,%templates/integration/tcp/uplink-decoder-json-payload-tcp.md%br%
Binary payload<br>%,%binary%,%templates/integration/tcp/uplink-decoder-binary-payload-tcp.md{% endcapture %}

{% include content-toggle.liquid content-toggle-id="tcpuplinkdecoderconfiguration" toggle-spec=tcpuplinkdecoderconfiguration %}

{% capture difference %}
**NOTE**
<br>
Although the Debug mode is very useful for development and troubleshooting, leaving it enabled in production mode may tremendously increase the disk space, used by the database, because all the debugging data is stored there. It is highly recommended to turn the Debug mode off when done debugging.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=difference %}

**3. Downlink data converter**.

At the step of adding a downlink converter, you can also select a previously created or create a new downlink converter. But for now, leave the "**Downlink data converter**" field empty. Click "**Skip**";

![image](/images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-integration-setup-3-pe.png)

<br>
**4. Connection**.

As you mentioned earlier, "**Execute remotely**" option is checked and can not be modified - TCP Integration can be only **remote** type.

By default, TCP Integration will use **10560** port, but you can change this to any available port in your case.

Please note down **Integration key** and **Integration secret** - we will use these values later in the configuration on the remote TCP Integration itself.

Choose device payload type for **Handler Configuration**

{% capture handlerconfiguration %}
Text payload<br>%,%text%,%templates/integration/tcp/tcp-handler-configuration-text.md%br%
JSON payload<br>%,%json%,%templates/integration/tcp/tcp-handler-configuration-json.md%br%
Binary payload<br>%,%binary%,%templates/integration/tcp/tcp-handler-configuration-binary.md{% endcapture %}

{% include content-toggle.liquid content-toggle-id="tcpintegrationhandlerconfiguration" toggle-spec=handlerconfiguration %}

![image](/images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-integration-setup-4-pe.png)

We leave other options by default, but there is brief description of them:
- **Max number of pending connects on the socket** - The maximum queue length for incoming connection indications (a request to connect) is set to the backlog parameter. If a connection indication arrives when the queue is full, the connection is refused;
- **Size of the buffer for inbound socket** - the size in KBytes of the socket data receive buffer;
- **Size of the buffer for outbound socket** - the size in KBytes of the socket data send buffer;
- **Enable sending of keep-alive messages on connection-oriented sockets** - a flag indicating that probes should be periodically sent across the network to the opposing socket to keep the connection alive;
- **Forces a socket to send the data without buffering (disable Nagle's buffering algorithm)** - disables Nagle's algorithm on the socket which delays the transmission of data until a certain volume of pending data has accumulated.

Click "**Add**" to finish adding the TCP integration.

## Installing and running external TCP Integration

Please refer to the [remote integration guide](/docs/{{peDocsPrefix}}user-guide/integrations/remote-integrations){:target="_blank"} and install TCP integration service locally or on separate machine.

Please use **Integration key** and **Integration secret** from the above section for your TCP Integration configuration.

## Send uplink message

Once ThingsBoard TCP Integration has been created, the TCP server starts, and then it waits for data from the devices.

Choose device payload type to send uplink message

{% capture senduplink %}
Text payload<br>%,%text%,%templates/integration/tcp/tcp-send-uplink-text.md%br%
JSON payload<br>%,%json%,%templates/integration/tcp/tcp-send-uplink-json.md%br%
Binary payload<br>%,%binary%,%templates/integration/tcp/tcp-send-uplink-binary.md{% endcapture %}

{% include content-toggle.liquid content-toggle-id="tcpintegrationsenduplink" toggle-spec=senduplink %}

Going to the "**Devices**" page you should find a **SN-002** device provisioned by the TCP integration.
Click on the device, navigate to the "**Latest telemetry**" tab to see "**temperature**" key and its value (25.7) there.

![image](/images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-integration-create-device-1-pe.png)

If your payload contains "**humidity**" telemetry, you should see "humidity" key and its value (69) there as well.

## Advanced usage: downlink

For sending downlink messages from the Thingsboard to the device, we need to define a downlink converter.

### Add downlink converter

Let's consider an example where we send an attribute update message. You can use our example of downlink converter, or write your own according to your configuration.

{% include templates/tbel-vs-js.md %}

{% capture tcpdownlink %}
TBEL<small>Recommended</small>%,%accessToken%,%templates/integration/tcp/tcp-downlink-tbel.md%br%
JavaScript<small></small>%,%anonymous%,%templates/integration/tcp/tcp-downlink-java.md{% endcapture %}

{% include content-toggle.liquid content-toggle-id="tcpdownlink" toggle-spec=tcpdownlink %}

To add a downlink data converter to the TCP integration, follow these steps:

{% assign tcpAddDownlinkConverter = '
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-add-downlink-converter-tbel-1-pe.png,
        title: Go to the "**Integrations**" page, click TCP integration to open its details, and enter integration editing mode by clicking the "pencil" icon;
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-add-downlink-converter-tbel-2-pe.png,
        title: Enter a name for the downlink data converter and click "**Create new converter**";
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-add-downlink-converter-tbel-3-pe.png,
        title: Paste the script to the encoder function section, and click "Add";
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-add-downlink-converter-tbel-4-pe.png,
        title: Apply changes.
'
%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=tcpAddDownlinkConverter %}

{% capture difference %}
Optionally, configure **Cache Size** and **Cache time to live in minutes** - features, that helps to avoid memory leak when we are storing connections (able just for TCP downlink).<br>
**Cache Size** - maximum size of messages for TCP client.<br>
**Cache time to live in minutes** - time to storage messages.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=difference %}

### Modify Root Rule Chain

When integration configured and ready to use, we need to go to the "Rule Chains" page and configure the "**Root Rule Chain**" so that "**Attributes updated**" messages is forwarded to the downlink data converter.

{% assign tcpRuleChainDownlink = '
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-rule-chain-downlink-pe.png,
        title: Open the "Root Rule Chain", find the "**integration downlink**" node and drag it to the rule chain. Name it "**TCP integration downlink**", specify **TCP integration**, and click "Add";
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-rule-chain-and-attributes-updated-pe.png,
        title: After this steps, we need to tap on a right grey circle of rule node "**message type switch**" and drag this circle to left side of "**integration downlink**", here lets choose **Attributes Updated**, tap "**Add**" and save Root Rule Chain.
'
%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=tcpRuleChainDownlink %}

### Test downlink

To test downlink, create some **shared attribute** on your device:

{% assign testDownlink = '
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-add-shared-attribute-1-pe.png,
        title: Go to the "**Devices**" page. Click your **SN-002** device and navigate to the "**Attributes**" tab. Select the "**Shared attributes**" option, and click the "**plus**" icon;
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-add-shared-attribute-2-pe.png,
        title: Enter the attribute name, and its value (for example, the key name is "**firmware**", value: "**v1.1**") and click "Save";
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-add-shared-attribute-3-pe.png,
'
%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=testDownlink %}

To receive a downlink message you need to set the timeout for responses `-w60` (this option determines how long you will wait for a response) and send the uplink message again:

```shell
echo -e 'SN-002,default,temperature,25.7\nSN-002,default,humidity,69' | nc -w60 127.0.0.1 11560
```
{: .copy-code}

You should get the following response from the ThingsBoard in the terminal:

![image](/images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-terminal-send-downlink-message.png)

Received data and data that was sent can be viewed in the downlink converter. In the "**In**" block of the "**Events**" tab, we see what data entered. The "**Out**" field displays messages to device.

{% assign eventsTab = '
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-downlink-converter-events-in-pe.png,
        title: Received data and data that was sent can be viewed in the downlink converter. In the "**In**" block of the "**Events**" tab, we see what data entered.
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/integrations/tcp/tcp-downlink-converter-events-out-pe.png,
        title: The "**Out**" field displays messages to device.
'
%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid imageCollection=eventsTab %}

{% capture difference %}
**Note**
<br>
When you use TCP integration, and your connection established for a long time, you will receive just one downlink message. All other will be saved on server side and will be sent on next uplink.
