### Overview

ThingsBoard allows you to schedule various types of events with flexible schedule configuration.
ThingsBoard Scheduler fires configured scheduler events according to their schedule.
When scheduler event is fired the [Rule Engine Message](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/overview/#rule-engine-message) is generated
from the event configuration which has a similar structure with a Rule Engine Message.
Generated message is then forwarded to [Rule Engine](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/re-getting-started/) and processed starting from
the [Root Rule Chain](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/overview/#rule-chain).

### Scheduler Administration

Tenant administrator and customer users are able to configure **Scheduler events** in ThingsBoard.

![image](/images/user-guide/ui/scheduler.png)

**Scheduler events** page displays current configured scheduler events.
It allows to add, update or delete scheduler events. The page can be presented in two modes **List view** or **Calendar view**.
The views can be switched by pressing corresponding icons in the page header.

In the calendar view mode scheduler events are presented as labels according to their schedule. 

![image](/images/user-guide/ui/scheduler-calendar-view.png)

By default calendar view is presented as **Month** view type.
**Calendar view type** dropdown allows to switch to other view types. The following view types can be selected:

- *Month / Week / Day / List Year / List Month / List Week / List Day / Agenda Week / Agenda Day*

New scheduler event can be created by clicking on `+` button in top right corner or by clicking on any cell of Calendar view.

#### Scheduler Event Dialog

![image](/images/user-guide/ui/scheduler-event-dialog.png)

**Configuration** form allows to set event type and event configuration parameters according to selected event type.
Configuration of scheduler event is described in [Scheduler Event Types](#scheduler-event-types) section.

**Schedule** form allows to setup event schedule configuration.

![image](/images/user-guide/ui/scheduler-event-schedule.png)

Schedule form has the following parameters:

- **Timezone** - timezone in which this scheduler event should be processed.
- **Start Date/Time** - date/time when this scheduler event should be fired.
- **Repeat** - if this scheduler event is one time or it should be repeated. 
- **Repeats** - repeat rule, can be either *Daily* or *Weekly*.
- **Repeat on** - applicable for *Weekly* repeat rule. Specifies weekdays when this scheduler event should be fired.
- **Ends on** - date until which this scheduler event should be repeated.
 

### Scheduler Event Types

In Configuration **Event type** field can be selected existing event type or specified custom one.

#### Custom Type

Custom type uses default scheduler event configuration form according to message structure.

![image](/images/user-guide/ui/scheduler-custom-event-type.png)

- **Originator** - message originator, can be *Single entity* (ex. Device, Asset etc.) or [*Group of entities*](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/groups/). If not specified, scheduler event entity itself will be considered as originator.
- **Message type** - message type according to the Rule Engine message types. Can be [existing message type](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/overview/#predefined-message-types) or custom. If not specified, scheduler event type will be considered as message type. 
- **Message body** - message body in JSON representation.
- **Metadata** - key/value table representing message metadata fields.

#### Generate Report

Allows to schedule reports generation supported by [Reporting](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/reporting/#generate-report-rule-chain) feature.

![image](/images/user-guide/ui/scheduler-generate-report-event-type-email-config.png)

- **Report configuration**:
    - **Base URL** - base URL of ThingsBoard UI that should be accessible by Report Server.
    - **Dashboard** - dashboard that will be used for report generation.
    - **Dashboard state parameter value** - used to specify target dashboard state for report generation. Can be set automatically by clicking on right most button of the field and invoking **Select dashboard state** dialog.

    - **Use dashboard timewindow** - if set, timewindow configured in the target dashboard will be used during report generation.
    - **Timewindow** - specific dashboard timewindow that will be used during report generation.
    - **Report name pattern** - file name pattern of generated report, can contain date-time pattern in form of `%d{date-time pattern}`. See [SimpleDateFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html) documentation for date-time pattern details.
    - **Report type** - report file type, can be *PDF \| PNG \| JPEG*.
    - **Use current user credentials** - if set, credentials of user created this report configuration will be used to open dashboard UI during report generation.
    - **Customer user credentials** - target customer user whose credentials will be used to open dashboard UI during report generation.
    - **Generate Test Report** button is used for testing purposes. It invokes report generation process with provided configuration. Resulting report file will be automatically downloaded if the report generation will be successful.

- **Entity attributes scope** - [scope](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/attributes/#attribute-types) of updated attributes. Can be selected if Device entity type is specified in **Target**. Can be either **Server attributes** or **Shared attributes**. For all other entity types **Server attributes** scope is used. 
- **Server / Shared attributes** - key/value table representing attributes with values to update.

#### Send RPC Request to Device

### Scheduler Widget

ThingsBoard provides ability to manage scheduler events via **Scheduler events** or **Reports schedule** Widgets which is part of **Scheduling** Widgets Bundle.

**Scheduler events** widget has same capabilities as [**Scheduler events** page](#scheduler-administration).
Additionally it can be customized with predefined forms for custom scheduler event types. 
This can be achieved by configuring list of **Custom event types** in **Advanced** tab of widget configuration.

- **Display name** - display name of custom event type.
- **Type name** - internal name of custom event.

- **Display message type select** - whether to allow select message type in scheduler event configuration form.
- **Display message metadata table** - whether to display metadata table in scheduler event configuration form.
