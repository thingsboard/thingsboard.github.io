### Overview

ThingsBoard has ability to store binary content (files) in the DataBase.
Currently it is used to store report files generated by [Generate Report Node](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/action-nodes/#generate-report-node).
Stored files are accessed by [Send Email Node](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/external-nodes/#send-email-node) to create email attachments.
Another way to send a file is the [REST API Call Node](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/external-nodes/#rest-api-call-node).
User can access stored files using **Files** or **Reports** widgets which is part of **Files** Widgets Bundle.
