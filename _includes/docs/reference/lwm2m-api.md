## Prerequisites

We assume you have completed the general [Getting Started](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}getting-started-guides/helloworld/) guide to get familiar with ThingsBoard.

## LwM2M basics

[LwM2M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMA_LWM2M) is a device management protocol designed for constrained devices and the demands of a machine-to-machine (M2M) environment.
You can find more information about LwM2M [here](https://omaspecworks.org/what-is-oma-specworks/iot/lightweight-m2m-LWM2M/).
Key advantage of the LwM2M protocol is a rich library of data structures that is called [LwM2M Object and Resource Registry](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html).
The up-to-date list of available objects is available inside [this](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry) Github repository.

The registry allows efficient serialization/deserialization of telemetry.
LwM2M Protocol defines process of device registration, configuration, management and firmware/software updates.

The LwM2M device supplies the list of LwM2M Objects it supports during registration.
The LwM2M Object has an ID, version and one or multiple instances. Each LwM2M Object instance has multiple resources.

The LwM2M resource is a key concept that represents some data you may get or write to device. 
For example, Resource "3.0.2" always represents the device serial number. Where "3" is the Object id, "0" is the Object instance and "2" is the resource id.

Each resource has the following main properties:

* Name - human readable name of the resource
* Type - data type: String, Integer, etc.
* Operations - R (read), RW (read-write), E (execute), etc.

## Getting started

This part of documentation covers provisioning of your first LwM2M device in ThingsBoard. We will use [Eclipse Wakaama](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama#test-client-example) test client to simulate LwM2M device.

### Step 1. Upload LwM2M models

{% unless docsPrefix == 'paas/' %}
System administrator is able to upload LwM2M models using "Resource library" UI located in the "System settings" menu.
One may upload multiple files at once. We recommend you to download list of available models from official [github](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry) repo and import all of them.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="upload-models" showListImageTitles="true" %}

{% endunless %}

<p> Tenant administrator is able to use LwM2M models defined by system administrator or overwrite them for the specific tenant.</p>

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="upload-tenant" showListImageTitles="true" %}


### Step 2. Define LwM2M device profile

Once you upload the LwM2M models, you are ready to use them to define the device profile.
See general device profile [documentation](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/device-profiles/) for more info about device profiles.

##### Step 2.1 Create the LwM2M profile.

The important step is to chose LwM2M Transport type on the "Transport configuration" step.
The Transport Configuration allows us to define list of the LwM2M Objects that your devices supports.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="device-profile" showListImageTitles="true" %}

##### Step 2.2 Choose LwM2M objects.

Let's define a profile that supports Device Object (id: 3), Connectivity (id: 4), Firmware Update (id: 5) and Location monitoring (id: 6):

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="device-objects" showListImageTitles="true" %}

##### Step 2.3 Configure the mapping

You may notice that Device Object supports Manufacturer, model, and serial numbers. Let’s configure ThingsBoard to fetch
those data when device connects and store it as ThingsBoard attributes.
Also we want to observe Radio Signal Strength, Link Quality and device location push it as ThingsBoard telemetry.
Observe is a powerful LwM2M feature that will instruct a device to report changes of those values.
You may also define conditions for reporting specific resource via LwM2M attributes. These settings are covered in the [advanced](#object-and-resource-attributes) documentation.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="data-fetch" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Note: if you un-check all items from the Object(Telemetry, Attributes, Observe) - this object will not be displayed in the
device profile.

Transport Configuration also allows you to define bootstrap and other settings.

### Step 3. Define LwM2M device credentials

We assume you have already created LwM2M device profile using the previous step.

Now, let's create the device using our profile and configure LwM2M Credentials.
ThingsBoard supports 4 different types of credentials: Pre-Shared Key (PSK), Raw Public Ket (RPK), X.509 Certificates and "No Security" mode.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="device-credentials" showListImageTitles="true" %}

For simplicity, we will connect device using plain UDP and "No Security" mode.
To connect such a device we just need to specify it's endpoint name in the device credentials.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="nosecurity-credentials" showListImageTitles="true" %}

You may use other types of credentials with the DTLS mode enabled. See [DTLS configuration](#dtls-configuration) for more info.

### Step 4. Connect the device

We assume you have already provisioned LwM2M device credentials using the previous step and also built Eclipse Wakaama [test client](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama#test-client-example).
Now you are ready to turn on the device and observe the incoming telemetry.

Let's launch the test client:

```bash
./lwm2mclient -h lwm2m.thingsboard.cloud -n UniqueEndpointName -p 5685 -c
```
{: .copy-code}

Where
* 'lwm2m.thingsboard.cloud' is the host name of the LwM2M server;
* '5685' is the port of LwM2M server;
* 'UniqueEndpointName' is the unique name of your endpoint. Please replace this with IMEI or other unique ID.


The LwM2M transport implementation also stores the logs of communication with the device into telemetry. You should see the "transportLog" in the device telemetry tab.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="wakaama-terminal" showListImageTitles="true" %}

## ThingsBoard LwM2M support

ThingsBoard implements both LwM2M server and bootstrap server that supports plain UDP and DTLS (secure transport over UDP).
As a platform user, you are able to provision and define the mapping between the LwM2M resources and ThingsBoard device [attributes](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/attributes/) and [time-series data](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/telemetry/).
The mapping is configured in the corresponding device profile. We will use some screenshots of the LwM2M device profile below to explain the basics. 
See the [Getting Started](#getting-started) guide for a step-by-step instruction to create the device profile.

#### Read LwM2M resources to ThingsBoard attributes

You may configure device profile to read and observe certain LwM2M Resource. 
The values of the resource may be stored as the device [attributes](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/attributes/). 
To do this, select the "Attribute" checkbox for the corresponding Resource. You may optionally change the auto-generated key name, defining the attribute name in ThingsBoard.
For example, let's configure the platform to read the LwM2M Resource */3/0/2* (Device Serial Number) and store it as an attribute *serialNumber* in ThingsBoard:

![image](/images/lwm2m/attributes-ce.png)

ThingsBoard will read the attribute value during device registration (LwM2M "Register" operation) or during registration update (LwM2M "Update" operation).

**Note:** 

We may optionally issue the "Observe" operation to make sure we subscribe to the updates of the LwM2M resource.
To do this, select the "Observe" checkbox for the corresponding Resource. Let's configure ThingsBoard to monitor the LwM2M Resource */3/0/15* (Timezone) and store it as the *timezone* attribute:

![image](/images/lwm2m/attributes-observe-ce.png)

Using the above configuration, we will make sure that the attribute *timezone* will always contain the latest value of the *Timezone* resource.

#### Write LwM2M resource via ThingsBoard attributes update

ThingsBoard [Shared Attributes](docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/attributes/#shared-attributes) are used to deliver the configuration updates to the device.
You may change the shared attribute in multiple ways - via administration UI, dashboard widget, REST API, or rule engine node. 
Once you change the shared attribute, ThingsBoard will search for the mapping between the attribute key and LwM2M resource.
If the resource is marked as an attribute, platform will send the LwM2M Write operation to the LwM2M client device.

See the *Timezone* example from the [read attributes](#read-lwm2m-resources-to-thingsboard-attributes)

#### Read LwM2M resources to time-series data

You may configure device profile to read and observe certain LwM2M Resource. The values of the resource may be stored as the device [time-series data](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/telemetry/).
To do this, select the "Telemetry" checkbox for the corresponding Resource. You may optionally change the auto-generated key name, defining the telemetry key in ThingsBoard.
For example, let's configure the platform to read the LwM2M Resources: */3/0/7* (Power Source Voltage), */3/0/8* (Power Source Current), */3/0/9* (Battery Level), and */3/0/10* (Memory Free),
and to store them as time-series data in ThingsBoard:

![image](/images/lwm2m/time-series-ce.png)

#### Execute LwM2M operation using the ThingsBoard RPC command

ThingsBoard supports on-demand LwM2M operations using RPC(Remote Procedure Call) feature. We also use "command" to device instead of RPC for simplicity. 
You can send the command using REST API, dashboard widget, rule engine, or custom script.
See the structure of the command is documented [here](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rpc/#server-side-rpc). 

Key properties of the command are *method* and *params*. 
The *method* defines the LwM2M operation and is one of the following: 

* [Execute](#execute-operation) - used by the LwM2M Server to initiate some action;
* [Read](#read-operation) - access the value of a Resource;
* [Discover](#discover-operation) - discover LwM2M Resources available on an Objects or Object Instances;
* [WriteUpdate](#write-operation) - change the value of a Resource;
* [WriteAttributes](#write-attributes-operation) - change attribute of the Resource;
* [ReadComposite](#read-composite-operation) - selectively read any combination of Objects;
* [WriteComposite](#write-composite-operation) - change the values of a number of different Resources across different Instances of one or more Objects;
* [Delete](#delete-operation) - delete an Object Instance within the LwM2M Client;
* [Observe](#observe-operation) - initiates an observation request for changes of a specific Resource;
* [ObserveCancel](#cancel-observation-operation) - ends an observation relationship that was previously created with an “Observe” operation;
* [ObserveCancelAll](#cancel-all-observations-operation) - Thingsboard-specific operation and allows to cancel all observations on the device at once;
* [ObserveReadAll](#read-all-observations-operation) - Thingsboard-specific operation and allows to get all observations that are set on the device;
* [DiscoverAll](#discover-all-operation) - Thingsboard-specific operation and allows to get the object and resources hierarchy, instantiated on the client.

The *params* is typically a JSON that defines the resource id or multiple resources ids. 
For example, to reboot the device one should execute the resource */3/0/4* (Reboot).

So, the following RPC command need to be sent to ThingsBoard:

```json
{
   "method": "Execute",
   "params": {"id": "/3/0/4"}
}
```
{: .copy-code}

We have prepared a simple dashboard with the ability to execute commands to device (*/3/0/4* Reboot) and update device attributes (*/3/0/15* Timezone). 
You may import the dashboard from [gist](https://gist.github.com/ashvayka/2374b1b6ebd8be5dca3d5252dee4c212#file-lwm2m_operations-json), once you complete the "Getting started" guide below. 
Don't forget to change the dashboard [alias](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/dashboards/#entity-aliases). 

## RPC Commands

LwM2M transport supports [RPC](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rpc/) commands that reflect subset of
[Device Management and Service Enablement Interface](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1_1-20190617-A.html#6-3-0-63-Device-Management-and-Service-Enablement-Interface)
and
[Information Reporting interface](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1_1-20190617-A.html#6-4-0-64-Information-Reporting-Interface).

The Device Management and Service Enablement Interface is used by the LwM2M Server to access Object Instances and Resources available from a registered LwM2M Client. The operations that a Resource supports are defined in the Object definition using the Object Template.

The Information Reporting Interface is used by a LwM2M Server to observe any changes in a Resource on a registered LwM2M Client, receiving notifications when new values are available. This observation relationship is initiated by sending an "Observe" or "Observe-Composite" operation to the L2M2M Client for an Object, an Object Instance or a Resource. An observation ends when a "Cancel Observation" or "Cancel Observation-Composite" operation is performed.

We will use the Debug Terminal widget to send commands to the device.


To execute attribute - oriented commands there are two ways to specify the target resource: by Resource ID and by the Key.

Resource  ID is the combination of "/ObjectId/ObjectInstance/ResourceID" numbers,
Where:

* 'ObjectId' Indicates the Object number. Objects used to group resources on the device, related to a certain functionality.
* 'ObjectInstance' Indicates the Object Instance to read.
* 'ResourceID' Indicates the Resource to read.

Example of plain RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "Read",
   "params": {"id": "/3/0/9"}
}
```
{: .copy-code}

or

```json
{
   "method": "Read",
   "params": {"key": "batteryLevel"}
}
```
{: .copy-code}


Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
Read {"id":"/3/0/9"}
```
{: .copy-code}

Key is a custom user-friendly name, assigned to a certain attribute:

Example for RPC debug terminal:

```ruby
Read {"key":"batteryLevel"}
```
{: .copy-code}

To be able to use the Key, you have to assign it to the attribute in the Device Profile configuration section:
* Go to the Device Profiles page;
* Click the Profile name;
* Click the “pencil” button on the top-right corner to edit profile;
* Go to Transport configuration tab;
* Switch to LWM2M Model tab;
* Select the target object and expand the Attributes list;
* Tick the “Attribute” checkbox on the desired attribute and type the Key name;
* Click save.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="device-objects-ce" %}

Below you can find examples of usage for commands that are supported by the Thingsboard platform for LWM2M protocol. Please note that your target client may not support all of them, please refer to the client’s documentation for detailed information on supported commands.


### Read Operation

The "Read" operation is used to access the value of a Resource, a Resource Instance, an array of Resource Instances,
an Object Instance or all the Object Instances of an Object.

<b> Example: Read the value of the resource by ID</b>

Example of plain RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "Read",
   "params": {"id": "/3/0/9"}
}
```
{: .copy-code}

Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
# Request:
Read {"id":"/3/0/9"}

# Response:
{"result":"CONTENT","value":"LwM2mSingleResource [id=9, value=100, type=INTEGER]"}
```
{: .copy-code}

{% endhighlight %}
</details>

### Discover Operation

The "Discover" operation is used to discover LwM2M Resources available on an Objects or Object Instances.
This operation can be used to discover which Resources are instantiated in a given Object Instance. The returned payload
is a list of application/link-format CoRE Links [RFC6690](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6690) for each targeted Object, Object Instance, or Resource, along
with their assigned or attached Attributes including the Object Version attribute if required.

Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "Discover",
   "params": {"id": "/3"}
}
```
{: .copy-code}


Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
# Request:
Discover {"id":"/3"}

# Response:
{"result":"CONTENT","value":"</3>,</3/0/0>,</3/0/1>,</3/0/2>,</3/0/3>,</3/0/4>,</3/0/5>,</3/0/6>,</3/0/7>,</3/0/8>,</3/0/9>,</3/0/10>,</3/0/11>,</3/0/12>,</3/0/13>,</3/0/

{% endhighlight %}
</details>

### Write Operation

The "Write" operation is used to change the value of a Resource, the value of a Resource Instance, the values of an array
of Resources Instances or the values of multiple Resources from an Object Instance. The "Write" operation can also be
used to request the deletion or the allocation of specific Instances of a Multiple-Instance Resource.

The request includes the value to be written encoded in one of the data format defined in
[7.4. Data Formats for Transferring Resource Information](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1_1-20190617-A.html#7-4-0-74-Data-Formats-for-Transferring-Resource-Information
): plain text, opaque, TLV, JSON, CoRE Link, CBOR, SenML JSON, and SenML CBOR.

There are two mechanisms to change multiple Resources or an array of Resource Instances:

Replace: replaces the Object Instance or the Resource(s) with the new value provided in the "Write" operation. When the Resource is a Multiple-Instance Resource, the existing array of Resource Instances is replaced to the condition the LwM2M Client authorizes that operation.

Partial Update: updates Resources provided in the new value and leaves other existing Resources unchanged. When the Resource is a Multiple-Instance Resource, the existing array of Resource Instances is updated meaning some Instances may be created or overwritten to the condition the LwM2M Client authorizes such operations. Deleting via Partial Update is not possible.

<b> Example: WriteUpdate Single ObjectInstance resource</b>

RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "WriteUpdate",
   "params": {"id":"/3/0","value":{"14":"+5","15":"Kiyv/Europe"}}
}
```
{: .copy-code}


Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
# Request:
WriteUpdate  {"id":"/3/0","value":{"14":"+5","15":"Kiyv/Europe"}}

# Response:
{"result":"CHANGED"}
```

### Write-Attributes Operation

Only Attributes from the NOTIFICATION class MAY be changed in using the "Write-Attributes" operation.
[Object and Resource attributes](http://localhost:4000/docs/reference/lwm2m-api/#object-and-resource-attributes) section provides explanation on the Attributes supported by the "Write-Attributes" operation: 
Minimum Period, Maximum Period, Greater Than, Less Than, Step.
The operation permits multiple Attributes to be modified within the same operation.

<b> Example: Write multiple attributes </b>

RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "WriteAttributes",
   "params": {"id":"/19/0/0","attributes":{"pmax":120, "pmin":10}}
}
```
{: .copy-code}


Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
# Request:
WriteAttributes {"id":"/19/0/0","attributes":{"pmax":120, "pmin":10}}

# Response:
{"result":"CHANGED"}
```
{: .copy-code}

### Read-Composite Operation

The LwM2M Client MAY support the "Read-Composite" operation.
The "Read-Composite" operation can be used by the LwM2M Server to selectively read any combination of Objects,
Object Instance(s), Resources, and/or Resource Instances of different or same Objects in a single request. The list of
elements to be read are provided as SenML Pack where the records contain Base Name and/or Name Fields, but no Value
fields. The Read-Composite operation is treated as non-atomic and handled as best effort by the client. That is, if any 
of the requested resources do not have a valid value to return, they will not be included in the response. 

<b> Example: Read multiple Objects </b>

RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "ReadComposite",
   "params": {"ids":["/3/0/9", "/1_1.2"]}
}
```
{: .copy-code}


Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
# Request:
ReadComposite {"ids":["/3/0/9", "/1_1.2"]}

# Response:
{"result":"CONTENT","value":"{/3/0/9=LwM2mSingleResource [id=9, value=75, type=INTEGER], /1=LwM2mObject [id=1, instances={0=LwM2mObjectInstance [id=0, resources={0=LwM2mSingleResource [id=0, value=123, t
ype=INTEGER], 1=LwM2mSingleResource [id=1, value=300, type=INTEGER], 6=LwM2mSingleResource [id=6, value=false, type=BOOLEAN], 22=LwM2mSingleResource [id=22, value=U, type=STRING], 7=LwM2mSingleResource [
id=7, value=U, type=STRING]}]}]}"

### Write Composite Operation

The LwM2M Client MAY support the "Write-Composite" operation.
In contrast to "Write" operation, the scope of which is limited to a Resource(s) of a single Instance of a single Object,
the "Write-Composite" operation can be used by the Server to update values of a number of different Resources across
different Instances of one or more Objects. The Write-Composite operation provides a list of
all resources to be updated, and their new values, using the SenML JSON/CBOR format. Unlike for Write operation, the
Resources that are not provided are not impacted by the operation.

The "Write-Composite" operation is atomic and cannot have partial success. That is, if the client supports this
operation, it MUST reject a Server request where it cannot successfully write all the requested values to the requested
list of Resources. Therefore, before processing Write-Composite, the client MUST ensure that all addressed objects exist
and that the Server has write access to those Objects and Resources.

<b> Example: WriteComposite to multiple Objects </b>

RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "WriteComposite",
   "params": {"nodes":{"/3/0/14":"+04", "/1/0/2":100, "/5/0/1":"coap://localhost:5685"}}
}
```
{: .copy-code}


Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
# Request:
WriteComposite {"nodes":{"/3/0/14":"+04", "/1/0/2":100, "/5/0/1":"coap://localhost:5685"}}

# Response:
{"result":"CHANGED"}
```
{: .copy-code}

# Request:
WriteComposite {"nodes":{"timezone":"+04", "defaultMinimumPeriod":100, "packageUri":"coap://localhost:5685"}}

# Response:
{"result":"CHANGED"}
{% endhighlight %}
</details>

### Execute Operation

The "Execute" operation is used by the LwM2M Server to initiate some action, and can only be performed on individual Resources.

<b> Example: Execute resource</b>

RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "Execute",
   "params": {"id":"5/0/2"}
}
```
{: .copy-code}


Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
# Request:
Execute {"id":"5/0/2"}

# Response:
{"result":"CHANGED"}
```
{: .copy-code}

### Delete Operation

The "Delete" operation is used for LwM2M Server to delete an Object Instance within the LwM2M Client.
The Object Instance that is deleted in the LwM2M Client by the LwM2M Server MUST be an Object Instance that is
announced by the LwM2M Client to the LwM2M Server using the "Register" and "Update" operations of the Client
Registration Interface.

The only exception concerns the single Instance of the mandatory Device Object (ID:3) which SHALL NOT be affected by
any Delete operation.

<b> Example: Delete an Object Instance</b>

RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "Delete",
   "params": {"id":"/19/1"}
}
```
{: .copy-code}


Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
# Request:
Delete {"id":"/19/1"}

# Response:
{"result":"DELETE"}
```
{: .copy-code}

### Observe Operation

The LwM2M Server initiates an observation request for changes of a specific Resource, Resources within an Object
Instance or for all the Object Instances of an Object within the LwM2M Client.
Related parameters for "Observe" operation are described in [Notification attributes](http://localhost:4000/docs/reference/lwm2m-api/#object-and-resource-attributes) Write-Attributes Operation and those
parameters are configured by "Write-Attributes" operation.

<b> Example: Observe resource</b>

RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "Observe",
   "params": {"id":"/3/0/9"}
}
```
{: .copy-code}


Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
# Request:
Observe {"id":"/3/0/9"}

# Response:
{"result":"CONTENT","value":"LwM2mSingleResource [id=9, value=28, type=INTEGER]"}
```
{: .copy-code}

[id=21, value=256000, type=INTEGER]}]"}
{% endhighlight %}
</details>

### Cancel Observation Operation

The "Cancel Observation" operation is sent from the LwM2M Server to the LwM2M Client to end an observation
relationship that was previously created with an "Observe" operation

<b> Example: Cancel Observation for resource by ID</b>

RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "ObserveCancel",
   "params": {"id":"/5/0/7"}
}
```
{: .copy-code}


Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
# Request:
ObserveCancel {"id":"/5/0/7"}

# Response:
{"result":"CONTENT","value":"1"}
```
{: .copy-code}

<b> More examples:</b>
<br>
<details>
<summary>
<b>Example: Cancel Observation for resource by Key</b>
</summary>
{% highlight ruby %}
# Request:
ObserveCancel {"key":"updateResult"}

# Response:
{"result":"CONTENT","value":"1"}{% endhighlight %}
</details>

### Cancel All Observations Operation

The "Cancel All Observations" operation is Thingsboard-specific operation and allows to cancel all observations
on the device at once

<b> Example: Cancel All Observations</b>

RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "ObserveCancelAll",
   "params": {}
}
```
{: .copy-code}


Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
# Request:
ObserveCancelAll

# Response:
{"result":"CONTENT","value":"8"} // - cancelled 8 observations
```
{: .copy-code}


### Read All Observations Operation

The "Read All Observations" operation is Thingsboard-specific operation and allows to get all observations 
that are set on the device.

<b> Example: Read All Observations</b>

RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "ObserveReadAll",
   "params": {}
}
```
{: .copy-code}


Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
# Request:
ObserveReadAll

# Response:
{"result":"CONTENT","value":"[\"/5/0/7\",\"/3/0/3\",\"/5/0/3\",\"/5/0/5\"]"}
```
{: .copy-code}

### Discover All Operation

The "Discover All Observations" operation is Thingsboard-specific operation and allows to get the object and resources hierarchy,
instantiated on the client. When DiscoverAll is executed, it doesn't send any request to the client device, instead it 
returns LwM2M model of the client device, which was created during the device connection to the server.
This command is very useful for device setting up and troubleshooting, as it allows to see available objects and their 
versions.

<b> Example: Discover all resources </b>


RPC call example for REST API: 

```json
{
   "method": "DiscoverAll",
   "params": {}
}
```
{: .copy-code}


Example of corresponding input in the debug terminal:

```ruby
# Request:
DiscoverAll

# Response:
{"result":"CONTENT","value":"[{\"url\":\"/\",\"attributes\":{\"ct\":\"110\",\"rt\":\"\\\"oma.lwm2m\\\"\"}},
{\"url\":\"/1\",\"attributes\":{\"ver\":\"1.1\"}},{\"url\":\"/1/0\",\"attributes\":{}},{\"url\":\"/2/0\",

## Firmware over-the-air updates

LwM2M protocol allows you to upload and distribute over-the-air(OTA) firmware updates to devices. Please read first the 
following article  [OTA updates](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ota-updates/) to learn about uploading and managing
firmware packages and the update process.

LwM2M defines [Object 5: Firmware Update Object](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1_1-20190617-A.html#13-6-0-E6-LwM2M-Object-Firmware-Update)
for the OTA purpose, which enables management of firmware image and includes resources for installing a firmware package,
updating firmware, and performing actions after updating firmware.

Please note that Object 5 is an optional object, and may be not supported by some devices.

To be able to run the update using Object 5, you have to make sure that Object 5 is present in the [Device profile](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}reference/lwm2m-api/#step-2-define-lwm2m-device-profile/)
LwM2M model and set up observations of following attributes on the device, which are used by the server to get feedback from
the device on the status of the update process:

    "/3/0/3" - Firmware Version
    "/5/0/3" - State
    "/5/0/5" - Update Result
    "/5/0/7" - PkgVersion

Firmware update process is illustrated here: [Firmware Update Mechanisms ](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1_1-20190617-A.html#Figure-E61-1-Firmware-Update-Mechanisms)
described as a UML 2.0 state diagram. The state diagram consists of states, drawn as rounded rectangles, and transitions,
drawn as arrows connecting the states.

There are several ways to run OTA firmware updates with LwM2M transport. You can choose the strategy in the device
profile, so it will be applied for all devices of the profile:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="otafirmware-transport" %}

### Push firmware update as binary file using Object 5 and Resource 0.
The firmware package is pushed from the server directly to the device via the block-wise transfer to the Resource 0 of
the Object 5. After the downloading is finished, the update process should be triggered using the executable 
resource "/5/0/2". The full process is illustrated here: [Example of a LwM2M Server pushing a firmware image to a LwM2M client](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1_1-20190617-A.html#Figure-E62-1-Example-of-a-LwM2M-Server-pushing-a-firmware-image-to-a-LwM2M-client).

### Auto-generate a unique CoAP URL to download the package and push the firmware package via Object 5 and Resource 1.
This option allows running the firmware update with the image file located on the 3rd party storage. In this case the
server generates a CoAP-URL and  sends it to the client, and the client downloads firmware image from the external
resource directly without transferring image to the server. After the downloading is finished, the update process should
be triggered using the executable resource "/5/0/2". The full process is illustrated here: [Example of a client fetching
a firmware image](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1_1-20190617-A.html#Figure-E62-2-Example-of-a-client-fetching-a-firmware-image/)

## Software over-the-air updates

LwM2M protocol allows you to upload and distribute over-the-air(OTA) software updates to devices. Please read first the
following article  [OTA updates](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ota-updates/) to learn about uploading and managing
software packages and the update process.

Updating of the device software has some differences comparing to the firmware update process: the Software Management
process is split in 2 sub-processes: a Package Installation Process and a Software Activation Process.

LwM2M defines Object 9: Software Management Object  for the software management  purpose, which enables remote 
software management in M2M devices and includes resources for delivering, execution of installation and activating 
software packages, and reporting states.

Please note that Object 9 is an optional object, and not may be supported by some devices.

To be able to run the update using Object 9, you have to make sure that Object 9 is present in the Device profile 
LwM2M model and set up observations of following attributes on the device, which are used by the server to get 
feedback from the device on the status of the update process:

    "/3/0/19" - Software Version
    "/9/0/0" - PkgName
    "/9/0/1" - PkgVersion
    "/9/0/2" - Package ID
    "/9/0/3" - Package URI
    "/9/0/7" - Update State
    "/9/0/9" - Update result

There are several ways to run OTA software updates with LwM2M transport. You can choose the strategy in the device 
profile, so it will be applied for all devices of the profile:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="sota" %}

### Push software update as binary file using Object 9 and Resource 2.
The software package is pushed from the server directly to the device via the block-wise transfer to the Resource 2 of 
the Object 9.

### Auto-generate a unique CoAP URL to download the package and push the software package via Object 9 and Resource 3.
This option allows running the software update with the image file located on the 3rd party storage. In this case 
the server generates a CoAP-URL and  sends it to the client, and the client downloads software image from the external 
resource directly without transferring image to the server.


## Advanced topics

### Object and Resource attributes

Please note that attributes in LwM2M context are different and not related to Server, Client or Shared attributes on 
the Thingsboard platform.

In LwM2M protocol, attributes are metadata which can be attached to an Object, an Object Instance, or a Resource. These 
attributes can fulfil various roles, from carrying information only to carrying parameters for setting up certain
actions on the LwM2M Client (e.g., Notifications).

Attributes attached to Objects, Object Instances, Resources are respectively named O-Attribute, OI-Attribute, R-Attribute.

These Attributes MAY be carried in the message payload of Registration and Discover operations; they also MAY be
updated - when writable - through the [Write-Attributes](http://localhost:4000/docs/reference/lwm2m-api/#write-attributes-operation) operation.

There are two types of attributes:

<b> PROPERTIES Class Attributes, or Object Attributes </b> 

The role of these Attributes is to provide metadata which may communicate helpful information to the LwM2M Server, for 
example easing data management. Thingsboard supports Object Version attribute, which indicates the version of the 
associated Object and is displayed in the results of [DiscoverAll](http://localhost:4000/docs/reference/lwm2m-api/#discover-all-operation) command.

You can find more details about all available in LwM2M Object attributes here:  [PROPERTIES Class Attributes](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1_1-20190617-A.html#Table-512-1-lessPROPERTIESgreater-Class-Attributes)


<b> NOTIFICATION Class Attributes, or Resource Attributes </b> 

The role of these R-Attributes is to provide parameters to the "Notify" operation, which is used for the resource 
observation. Any readable Resource can have such R-attributes.

Following NOTIFICATION attributes are available on the TB Platform to configure observation parameters:

* "pmin"  - Minimum period - indicates the minimum time in seconds the LwM2M Client MUST wait between two notifications.
  If a notification of an observed Resource is supposed to be generated but it is before pmin expiry,
  notification MUST be sent as soon as pmin expires. In the absence of this parameter, the Minimum Period is
  defined by the Default Minimum Period set in the LwM2M Server Account.

* "pmax"  - Maximum period -  indicates the maximum time in seconds the LwM2M Client MAY wait between two notifications.
  When this "Maximum Period" expires after the last notification, a new notification MUST be sent. In the absence
  of this parameter, the "Maximum Period" is defined by the Default Maximum Period when set in the LwM2M Server
  Account or considered as 0 otherwise. The value of 0, means pmax MUST be ignored. The maximum period parameter
  MUST be greater than the minimum period parameter otherwise pmax will be ignored for the Resource to which
  such inconsistent timing conditions are applied.

* "gt"    - Greater than - defines a threshold high value. When this Attribute is present, the LwM2M Client MUST notify
  the Server each time the Observed Resource value crosses this threshold with respect to pmin parameter and
  valid "Change Value Conditions" (see Notification Conditions above).

* "lt"    - Less than - defines a threshold low value. When this Attributes is present, the LwM2M Client MUST notify the
  Server each time the Observed Resource value crosses this threshold with respect to pmin parameter and valid
  "Change Value Conditions" (see Notification Conditions above).

* "st"    - Step - defines a threshold low value. When this Attributes is present, the LwM2M Client MUST notify the Server
  each time the Observed Resource value crosses this threshold with respect to pmin parameter and valid "Change
  Value Conditions" (see Notification Conditions above).

Please find more more details about all available in LwM2M NOTIFICATION attributes [here.](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1_1-20190617-A.html#Table-512-2-lessNOTIFICATIONgreater-class-Attributes).

Notification attributes can be configured in the Device Profile, please follow the guide:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="object-attributes" %}


### DTLS configuration

The Thingsboard platform supports secured connection using DTLS. DTLS, which stands for Datagram Transport Layer
Security, is based on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and built on top of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
Thingsboard allows the use of DTLS  with the LwM2M transport connection for devices.

You can find detailed information about `LWM2M DTLS-based Security` [here](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_2-20201110-A/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Transport-V1_2-20201110-A.pdf#page=19).

There are three authentication methods available on the Thingsboard for LwM2M DTLS: using the Pre-Shared Key(PSK), using
the Raw Public Key(RPK) and using the X.509 certificate.

To use DTLS, the end-user device has to connect to the ThingsBoard server using secured port 5686.

For the demonstration purpose we will use Leshan Demo Client, please refer to the link for downloading and configuration: [here](https://github.com/eclipse/leshan)

#### 1. Pre-shared Key mode (PSK).

The pre-shared key profile offers the most resource-efficient solution for integration of DTLS into LwM2M since pre-shared
ciphersuites recommended in [RFC7925] require a minimum amount of flash space as well as RAM in your device.

Symmetric cryptographic algorithms require only a minimal computational overhead. The size of the exchanged messages
is also kept at a minimum. There is, however, a downside as well: symmetric keys need to be preconfigured to both
communication endpoints.

You need only three strings to configure the connection in the Device profile:

* Endpoint client name: which is used to identify the device and can be any text string.
* Client identity (PSK identity) key: any text string.
* PSK key (security key): should be a random sequence in HexDec format and 32, 64 or 128 characters long.

Example of using  Leshan Demo Client:

    Endpoint client name= "ClientPsk";
    Client identity (PSK identity) = "ClientPskIdentity";
    Client key (PSK key or PSK security key) = "0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF";

Example command for start "Leshan client demo" in mode PSK:

```ruby
java -jar leshan-client-demo.jar -u localhost:5686 -lh 0.0.0.0 -lp 10004 -n ClientPsk -i ClientPskIdentity 
-p 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
    
Leshan Client Demo Interactive Console :
...
DefaultRegistrationEngine 2021-09-30 19:09:52,789 [INFO] Trying to register to coaps://192.168.1.81:5686 ...
LeshanClientDemo 2021-09-30 19:09:52,830 [INFO] DTLS Full Handshake initiated by client : STARTED ...

DefaultRegistrationEngine 2021-09-30 19:09:52,990 [INFO] Registered with location '/rd/vXMGfVFgQi'.
...
```
{: .copy-code}


#### 2. Raw Public Key(RPK) mode.

The raw public key profile offers features that sit between the pre-shared key and the certificate-based mode and
combines the benefits of these two profiles. The use of asymmetric cryptography offers improved security but avoids
the overhead associated with certificates and the public key infrastructure.

To configure the connection, you need to do following steps:

   * Generate Client keys and copy-paste the Client Public key to the Device Credentials - Client Key on the Thingsboard platform.
   * Generate Server keys and add them to the Server key-storage file lwm2mserver.jks, copy the file back to the server installation folder.
   * Configure your client’s connection.

We will use OpenSSl tool and follow the guide from Leshan: [here](https://github.com/eclipse/leshan/wiki/Credential-files-format)

<b>Note:</b> This step requires Linux-based OS with Java installed.

1. Create a separate folder where we will keep all generated keys.
2. Thingsboard keeps server keys in the key-storage file "lwm2mserver.jks", please find and copy this file to our folder.
   Default key file location is:

```ruby
/common/transport/lwm2m/src/main/resources/credentials/lwm2mserver.jks
```
{: .copy-code}

{:start="3"}
3. We will use the script below to generate all necessary keys. Just create a text file with any text editor, copy the 
script into it and save the file with *.sh extention, for example 'generate-rpk.sh'
