## Python REST Client

The ThingsBoard Python REST API Client helps you interact with ThingsBoard REST API from your Python script.
With Python Rest Client you can programmatically create assets, devices, customers, users and other entities and their relations in ThingsBoard.

Source code of the Python REST API Client you can find [here](https://github.com/thingsboard/python_tb_rest_client).

In order to install the ThingsBoard Python REST client, you should use the following command:

```bash
pip3 install tb-rest-client
``` 

## Python REST Client example

You can find the example script **[here](https://github.com/thingsboard/python_tb_rest_client/blob/master/examples/example_application.py)**.

```python

import logging
# Importing models and REST client class from Community Edition version
from tb_rest_client.rest_client_ce import *
# Importing the API exception
from tb_rest_client.rest import ApiException


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,
                    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(module)s - %(lineno)d - %(message)s',
                    datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

# ThingsBoard REST API URL
url = "http://localhost:8080"
# Default Tenant Administrator credentials
username = "tenant@thingsboard.org"
password = "tenant"


# Creating the REST client object with context manager to get auto token refresh
with RestClientCE(base_url=url) as rest_client:
    try:
        # Auth with credentials
        rest_client.login(username=username, password=password)

        # Creating an Asset
        asset = Asset(name="Building 1", type="building")
        asset = rest_client.save_asset(asset)

        logging.info("Asset was created:\n%r\n", asset)

        # creating a Device
        device = Device(name="Thermometer 1", type="thermometer")
        device = rest_client.save_device(device)

        logging.info(" Device was created:\n%r\n", device)

        # Creating relations from device to asset
        relation = EntityRelation(_from=asset.id, to=device.id, type="Contains")
        relation = rest_client.save_relation(relation)

        logging.info(" Relation was created:\n%r\n", relation)
    except ApiException as e:
        logging.exception(e)

```
