## Experiments

Postgres + Kafka + Cassandra

### Max msg rate experiments Cassandra 4.0 m6a.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 32 GiB)

Cassandra 4.0 m6a.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 32 GiB)

5k devices, 15k msg/sec, 45k data points/sec -- 100% handled

CPU is about 60%, so bottleneck happens.

Let's try to write time series without persisting latest values to the PostgreSQL - no effect
