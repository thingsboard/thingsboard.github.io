SDK supports:
- Unencrypted and encrypted (TLS v1.2) connection;
- QoS 0 and 1;
- Automatic reconnect;
- All [**Device MQTT APIs**](/docs/reference/mqtt-api/)
- All [**Gateway MQTT APIs**](/docs/reference/gateway-mqtt-api/)

SDK is based on Paho MQTT library. 

## Installation

To install using pip:

```bash
pip3 install tb-mqtt-client
```

## Getting Started

Client initialization and telemetry publishing.

```python
from tb_device_mqtt import TBDeviceMqttClient, TBPublishInfo


telemetry = {"temperature": 41.9, "enabled": False, "currentFirmwareVersion": "v1.2.2"}
client = TBDeviceMqttClient("127.0.0.1", "A1_TEST_TOKEN")
# Connect to ThingsBoard
client.connect()
# Sending telemetry without checking the delivery status
client.send_telemetry(telemetry) 
# Sending telemetry and checking the delivery status (QoS = 1 by default)
result = client.send_telemetry(telemetry)
# get is a blocking call that awaits delivery status  
success = result.get() == TBPublishInfo.TB_ERR_SUCCESS
# Disconnect from ThingsBoard
client.disconnect()

```

### Connection using TLS

TLS connection to localhost. See [MQTT over SSL](/docs/user-guide/mqtt-over-ssl/) for more information about client and ThingsBoard configuration.
To connect to ThingsBoard with MQTT over SSL, first, you should generate a certificate and have a code like the following one:

```python
from socket import gethostname
from tb_device_mqtt import TBDeviceMqttClient


client = TBDeviceMqttClient(gethostname())
client.connect(tls=True,
               ca_certs="mqttserver.pub.pem",
               cert_file="mqttclient.nopass.pem")
client.disconnect()

```

## Using Device APIs

**TBDeviceMqttClient** provides access to Device MQTT APIs of ThingsBoard platform.  
It allows publishing telemetry and attributes updates, subscribing to attribute changes, sending and receiving RPC commands, etc.    

#### Subscribtion to attributes

If you need to receive shared attributes updates, you can use the code like the following:  

```python
from time import sleep
from tb_device_mqtt import TBDeviceMqttClient


def callback(result):
    print(result)

client = TBDeviceMqttClient("127.0.0.1", "A1_TEST_TOKEN")
client.connect()
client.subscribe_to_attribute("uploadFrequency", callback)
client.subscribe_to_all_attributes(callback)
while True:
    sleep(1)

```

#### Telemetry pack sending

In order to send data to ThingsBoard you can use code like the following one:

```python
from time import time
from tb_device_mqtt import TBDeviceMqttClient, TBPublishInfo


telemetry_with_ts = {"ts": int(round(time() * 1000)), "values": {"temperature": 42.1, "humidity": 70}}
client = TBDeviceMqttClient("127.0.0.1", "A1_TEST_TOKEN")
# we set maximum amount of messages sent to send them at the same time. it may stress memory but increases performance
client.max_inflight_messages_set(100)
client.connect()
results = []
result = True
for i in range(0, 100):
    results.append(client.send_telemetry(telemetry_with_ts))
for tmp_result in results:
    result &= tmp_result.get() == TBPublishInfo.TB_ERR_SUCCESS
print("Result", str(result))
client.disconnect()

```

#### Request attributes from server

In order to request shared attributes values from ThingsBoard you can use the following example:

```python
from time import sleep
from tb_device_mqtt import TBDeviceMqttClient


def on_attributes_change(result, exception):
    if exception is not None:
        print("Exception:", str(exception))
    else:
        print(result)

client = TBDeviceMqttClient("127.0.0.1", "A1_TEST_TOKEN")
client.connect()
client.request_attributes(["configuration","targetFirmwareVersion"], callback=on_attributes_change)


while True:
    sleep(1)

```
#### Respond to server RPC call

If you want to send a response for some RPC request, you can use the logic like in the code below.  
The following example connects to the ThingsBoard local instance and waits for RPC request.  
When RPC request is received, the client will send the response to ThingsBoard with data from machine with client for device with the name **Test Device A1**.  

```python
from psutil import cpu_percent, virtual_memory
from time import sleep
from tb_device_mqtt import TBDeviceMqttClient


# dependently of request method we send different data back
def on_server_side_rpc_request(client, request_id, request_body):
    print(request_id, request_body)
    if request_body["method"] == "getCPULoad":
        client.send_rpc_reply(request_id, {"CPU percent": cpu_percent()})
    elif request_body["method"] == "getMemoryUsage":
        client.send_rpc_reply(request_id, {"Memory": virtual_memory().percent})

client = TBDeviceMqttClient("127.0.0.1", "A1_TEST_TOKEN")
client.set_server_side_rpc_request_handler(on_server_side_rpc_request)
client.connect()


while True:
    sleep(1)

```
## Using Gateway APIs

**TBGatewayMqttClient** extends **TBDeviceMqttClient**, thus has access to all its APIs as a regular device.   
Besides, gateway is able to represent multiple devices connected to it. For example, sending telemetry or attributes on behalf of other, constrained, device. See more info about the gateway [**here**](/docs/iot-gateway/).  

#### Telemetry and attributes sending 

In order to send data to ThingsBoard for device with name **Test Device A1** you can use code like the following one:

```python
from time import time
from tb_gateway_mqtt import TBGatewayMqttClient


gateway = TBGatewayMqttClient("127.0.0.1", "GATEWAY_TEST_TOKEN")
gateway.connect()
gateway.gw_connect_device("Test Device A1")

gateway.gw_send_telemetry("Test Device A1", {"ts": int(round(time() * 1000)), "values": {"temperature": 42.2}})
gateway.gw_send_attributes("Test Device A1", {"firmwareVersion": "2.3.1"})

gateway.gw_disconnect_device("Test Device A1")
gateway.disconnect()

```


####  Request attributes from server

In order to request shared attributes values from ThingsBoard for device with name **Test Device A1** you can use the following example:

```python
from time import sleep
from tb_gateway_mqtt import TBGatewayMqttClient


def callback(result, exception):
    if exception is not None:
        print("Exception: " + str(exception))
    else:
        print(result)

gateway = TBGatewayMqttClient("127.0.0.1", "TEST_GATEWAY_TOKEN")
gateway.connect()
gateway.gw_request_shared_attributes("Test Device A1", ["temperature"], callback)

while True:
    sleep(1)

```

#### Respond to server RPC call

If you want to send response for some RPC request, you can use the logic like in the code below.  
The following example will connect to the ThingsBoard local instance and wait for RPC request.  
When RPC request will be received, client will send response to ThingsBoard with data for device with name **Test Device A1**.  

```python

from time import sleep
from psutil import cpu_percent, virtual_memory
from tb_gateway_mqtt import TBGatewayMqttClient


def rpc_request_response(client, request_id, request_body):
    # request body contains id, method and other parameters
    print(request_body)
    method = request_body["data"]["method"]
    device = request_body["device"]
    req_id = request_body["data"]["id"]
    # dependently of request method we send different data back
    if method == 'getCPULoad':
        gateway.gw_send_rpc_reply(device, req_id, {"CPU load": cpu_percent()})
    elif method == 'getMemoryLoad':
        gateway.gw_send_rpc_reply(device, req_id, {"Memory": virtual_memory().percent})
    else:
        print('Unknown method: ' + method)

gateway = TBGatewayMqttClient("127.0.0.1", "TEST_GATEWAY_TOKEN")
gateway.connect()
# now rpc_request_response will process rpc requests from servers
gateway.gw_set_server_side_rpc_request_handler(rpc_request_response)
# without device connection it is impossible to get any messages
gateway.gw_connect_device("Test Device A1")

while True:
    sleep(1)

```
