## Overview

The ThingsBoard **Over-the-Air (OTA) Update** feature is a powerful way to remotely manage device firmware or software, reducing the need for manual updates and enabling rapid deployment of enhancements or fixes.

The **Edge OTA Update** feature is designed similarly to the **Platform (Cloud) OTA Update**. As a result, the **Edge OTA Update** packages can be deployed in both Device and Device Profile configurations in the same manner as **Platform** Device and Device Profile configurations.
Please refer to the [Platform OTA Updates documentation](/docs/{{cloudDocsPrefix}}user-guide/ota-updates/) for a general understanding of the **OTA Update** feature.

## Provisioning OTA Packages to the ThingsBoard Repository

All **OTA firmware and software packages** are created on the Platform and **automatically propagated** to each **Edge** instance connected to it. No additional actions are required from the Tenant administrator or User.

**Please note!** <br>
The **OTA Update packages** are created on the **ThingsBoard Platform**. It is **not possible to create, modify, or delete** the OTA Update packages on the **Edge** instance.

* **"Upload binary file"/"Use external URL" radiobutton:** Select the file package source. Depending on the selected option, the following will occur:

  * **Direct URL:** Enter a direct URL to download the file.
