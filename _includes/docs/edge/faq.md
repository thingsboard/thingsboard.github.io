## General Questions

### What is ThingsBoard Edge {{edgeName}}? 
{% if docsPrefix == "pe/edge/" or docsPrefix contains "pe/edge/" %}
<p><b>ThingsBoard Edge Professional Edition (PE)</b> is a commercial version of <b>ThingsBoard Edge</b> designed specifically for edge computing scenarios. It provides advanced features and enterprise-grade support for managing and analyzing IoT data at the edge while maintaining seamless synchronization with the <b>ThingsBoard Server (Cloud or On-premise)</b>.</p>
<p>If you're new to edge computing, we recommend exploring <a href="/docs/{{docsPrefix}}getting-started-guides/what-is-edge/" target="_blank">What is Edge?</a> and the <a href="/docs/{{docsPrefix}}getting-started/" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> guides for more detailed information.</p>
{% else %}
<p><b>ThingsBoard Edge Community Edition (CE)</b> is a free, open-source platform designed specifically for edge computing scenarios. It provides essential capabilities for managing and analyzing IoT data at the edge, while staying seamlessly synchronized with the <b>ThingsBoard Server (Cloud or On-premise)</b>.</p>
<p>If you're new to edge computing, we recommend exploring <a href="/docs/{{docsPrefix}}getting-started-guides/what-is-edge/" target="_blank">What is Edge?</a> and the <a href="/docs/{{docsPrefix}}getting-started/" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> guides for more detailed information.</p>
{% endif %}


### Can I customize and modify the ThingsBoard {{edgeName}}?
{% if docsPrefix == "pe/edge/" or docsPrefix contains "pe/edge/" %}
<p>No, the <b>ThingsBoard {{edgeName}}</b> is a commercial project and can not be modified.</p>
{% else %}
<p>Yes, the source code is available on GitHub, and you can fork and modify it to suit your needs. By the way, please consider starring <a href="https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard-edge" target="_blank">our repository</a>.</p> 
{% endif %}

### Does ThingsBoard Edge support clustering? 
<p>No, <b>ThingsBoard Edge</b> does not support clustering at the moment. But cluster support will be added in the following releases.</p>

### Do I need an internet connection to use the ThingsBoard Edge?
<p>No, you can run it completely offline if you need to. The only connection required is to the <b>ThingsBoard Server</b> via <a href="https://grpc.io/" target="_blank">gRPC</a>.</p>
{% if docsPrefix == 'pe/edge/' %}
<p>However, <b>ThingsBoard Edge</b> does utilize an HTTP(s) connection to the <b>ThingsBoard Server</b> to verify the license.
The URL set in the <b>Cloud Endpoint</b> configuration is used for this validation.
Ensure that the HTTP(s) connection to the server is not blocked by any firewall settings.
The ThingsBoard Server acts as a proxy for ThingsBoard Edge to connect to the <a href="https://license.thingsboard.io/login" target="_blank">ThingsBoard License Portal</a>.</p>
{% endif %}

{% if docsPrefix == 'pe/edge/' %}

### How will the license check be carried out if the connection to the ThingsBoard Server is temporarily not available?
<p><b>ThingsBoard Edge</b> can operate offline, without a connection to the <b>ThingsBoard Server</b>, for up to <b>7 days</b>.</p>

{% endif %}

## Installation & Deployment 

### Does the ThingsBoard Edge support multi-tenancy? 
{% if docsPrefix == 'pe/edge/' %}
<p>No, <b>ThingsBoard Edge Professional Edition</b> does not support multi-tenancy. It is designed for a <b>single tenant</b> and <b>multiple customers</b>, but the customer hierarchy must be taken into account</p>
<p>For instance, if an Edge owner is a sub-customer, all the parent entities of that sub-customer up to the tenant level will be provisioned to the Edge.
This means customers from the same hierarchy path can access the same ThingsBoard Edge PE instance.</p>
<p>However, you cannot share a ThingsBoard Edge between multiple tenants, and devices from multiple tenants cannot connect to a single <b>ThingsBoard Edge</b>.
If this is required, you'll need to provision multiple <b>ThingsBoard Edge</b> instances for each tenant.</p>
{% else %}
<p>No, <b>ThingsBoard Edge Community Edition</b> does not support multi-tenancy. It is designed for a <b>single tenant</b> and a <b>single customer</b>, which means that you cannot share a single <b>ThingsBoard Edge</b> instance between multiple tenants or customers, devices from different tenants cannot be connected to the same <b>ThingsBoard Edge</b> instance.</p>
<p>If this is required, you'll need to provision multiple <b>ThingsBoard Edge</b> instances for each tenant.</p>
{% endif %}


### Is there an official Docker image for ThingsBoard Edge?
<p>Yes, official <b>Docker images</b> are available on <b>Docker Hub</b>.</p>

### Can I run ThingsBoard Edge on Raspberry Pi or other edge devices? 
<p>Yes, <b>ThingsBoard Edge</b> is specifically designed to run on a variety of Edge hardware platforms, including single-board computers like <b>Raspberry Pi</b> and other devices with sufficient processing power and memory.</p>

### Where does ThingsBoard Edge store time-series data?
<p>Depending on your database approach, there are two options. If you've chosen a <b>hybrid approach</b>, the time-series data will be stored in <b>Cassandra</b>. Otherwise, the data is stored in the <b>PostgreSQL</b> database, which is well suited for storing and querying entities and local time-series data.</p>

### What should I do if I have legacy devices to connect? 
<p>If you have legacy devices that don't natively speak one of the protocols supported by <b>ThingsBoard Edge</b> (such as MQTT, CoAP, or HTTP), you can still connect them by installing <a href="/docs/iot-gateway/" target="_blank">ThingsBoard IoT Gateway</a>. It will act as a bridge between your legacy devices and <b>ThingsBoard Edge</b>.</p>
<p><b>ThingsBoard IoT Gateway</b> is available out-of-the-box and requires no additional fees.</p>

<p><b>ThingsBoard Edge</b> doesnâ€™t impose a fixed limit on the number of devices you can connect.</p>
<p>In practice, the number of devices you can support depends largely on your hardware resources, system configuration, and the specific use case. 
Since <b>ThingsBoard Edge</b> is designed with remote locations with potentially low bandwidth connectivity in mind, we do not recommend connecting more than <b>1000</b> devices to a single edge.</p>
