This guide demonstrates basic usage of popular ThingsBoard features. You will learn how to:

- Connect devices to ThingsBoard
- Push data from devices to ThingsBoard
- Build real-time dashboards
- Create a Customer and share the dashboard with them.
- Define thresholds and trigger alarms
- Set up notifications via email, SMS, mobile apps, or integrate with third-party services.

For simplicity, we&#39;ll visualize data from a temperature sensor.

{% include templates/prerequisites-pe.md %}

## Step 1. Provision device

As an example, let&#39;s add a device that will transmit the following data to ThingsBoard platform: the device&#39;s name and temperature readings as telemetry.

To add a new device, follow these steps:
 
{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step1" showListImageTitles="true" %} 

You will also receive a notification upon adding devices. Click the bell icon (top right) to view notifications.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step11" %}

[Learn more about notifications here](#step-6-alarm-notifications).

**Additional provisioning methods**
- [Bulk provisioning](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/bulk-provisioning/){:target="_blank"}: Import multiple devices via CSV through the UI.
- [Device provisioning](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/device-provisioning/){:target="_blank"}: Configure devices to self-register automatically. 
- [REST API](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}api/){:target="_blank"} provisioning: Manage devices programmatically through APIs.

## Step 2. Connect device

Let&#39;s verify your device&#39;s connection to ThingsBoard:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step2" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Explore [ThingsBoard API reference](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}api){:target="_blank"}. Here you will find more detailed information about all supported protocols for connecting devices.

## Step 3. Create dashboard

A dashboard in ThingsBoard allows users to visualize and monitor data collected from IoT devices.

Let&#39;s create a dashboard and add three widgets to it in order to display a list of entities and their latest values, as well as show alarm signals related to the specified entity.

### Step 3.1 Create an empty dashboard

To create a new dashboard, follow these steps:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step31" showListImageTitles="true" %}

### Step 3.2 Add an Entities table widget

The "Entities table" widget displays a list of entities and their latest values. 
The list of entities corresponds to selected devices or other entities, and filters with the ability of additional full-text search and pagination options.

To add the table widget we need to select it from the widget library. Widgets are grouped into widget bundles.
Each widget has a data source. This is how the widget "knows" what data to display.
To see the latest value of our "temperature" data that we sent during step 2, we should configure the data source.

Let&#39;s add your first widget:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step32" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Congratulations! You&#39;ve added your first widget.

In the "Entities table" widget, there are two columns. 
The first column displays the device&#39;s name, and the second column displays the value of the "temperature" key (device telemetry). 
So, each column corresponds to an added key.

Now you are able to send a new telemetry reading (as in [Step 1](#step-1-provision-device)), and it will immediately appear in the table.

### Step 3.3 Add a Chart widget

Chart widgets allow you to display time series data with customizable line charts and bar charts.

To add the chart widget we need to select it from the widget library. 
Chart widget displays multiple historical values of the same data key ("temperature" in our case).
We should also configure the time window to use the chart widget.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step33" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Congratulations! You have added the chart widget. Now you are able to send a new telemetry reading, and it will immediately appear in the chart. 

You can also adjust the time interval for displaying data in the widget, change the aggregation function, and specify the grouping interval.
To do this, open the [Time window](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/dashboards/#time-window){:target="_blank"} and make the necessary adjustments. Update the time window settings by clicking the "Update" button.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step33_2" %}

### Step 3.4 Add an Alarms table widget

The alarms table widget displays alarms related to the specified entity in the certain time window.
Alarm widget is configured by specifying an entity as the alarm source, and the corresponding alarm fields.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step34" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Now it&#39;s time to configure alarm rules and raise some alarms. 

> **Note:** in this documentation, we are using a single device as a data source for the widgets. 
To use dynamic entities (for example, devices of a certain type or related to a certain asset) as data source, you should use the alias.
Alias is a reference to a single entity or a group of entities that are used in the widgets. 
You may learn more [about different aliases here](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/aliases/){:target="_blank"}.

## Step 4. Configure alarm rules

We&#39;ll use the [alarm rules](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/device-profiles/#alarm-rules){:target="_blank"} feature to define a rule that triggers an alarm when the temperature exceeds 25 °C.
Alarm rules are configured in the [device profile](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/device-profiles/){:target="_blank"} used by the target device. 

In our example, "My new device" uses the "default" device profile. While it&#39;s best practice to create separate profiles for each device type, we&#39;ll skip that step here for simplicity.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step4" showListImageTitles="true" %}

## Step 5. Create alarm

Now, our alarm rule is active (see [Step 4](#step-4-configure-alarm-rules)), and we should send new telemetry on behalf of the device (see [Step 2](#step-2-connect-device)) to trigger the alarm.
> Note that the temperature value should be **26 or higher** to raise the alarm. Once we send a new temperature reading, we should immediately see a new alarm on our dashboard.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step5" showListImageTitles="true" %}

We also recommend reviewing alarm rule [examples](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/device-profiles/#alarm-rules){:target="_blank"} and documentation about [alarm notifications](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/device-profiles/#notifications-about-alarms){:target="_blank"}.

## Step 6. Alarm notifications

The ThingsBoard [Notification center](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/notifications/){:target="_blank"} allows personalized notifications to end-users regarding device activities, environmental changes, or events in your IoT ecosystem, and more.
Notifications can be delivered via email, SMS, or integrated third-party systems.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="notification-center" %}

Additionally, [ThingsBoard PE Mobile Application](/docs/pe/mobile/){:target="_blank"} provides instant push notifications directly to your smartphone, ensuring you&#39;re always informed of critical events wherever you are.

Follow [this guide](/docs/pe/mobile/getting-started/){:target="_blank"} to install the ThingsBoard mobile app and set up notifications.

Enjoy exploring ThingsBoard!

## Step 7. Share dashboard with customers

One of the most important ThingsBoard features is the ability to create end-user dashboards.
Each Customer User should see his own devices and should not be able to see devices or any other data that belongs to a different customer. 

We have already created the Device (see [Step 1](#step-1-provision-device)), the Dashboard and added widgets to it (see [Step 3](#step-3-create-dashboard)).
Now it&#39;s time to create a Customer and a Customer User and make sure they will have access to the device&#39;s data and the dashboard.
There are two options for how Tenant Administrator can give access to a certain Entity (Device, Dashboard, Asset, etc.) for a Customer:

* A. Assign the Customer as the owner of the entity. This option is useful to ensure that only this customer can access the device and its data (see [Step 7.2](#step-72-change-owner-of-the-device)).
* B. Share the entity with the Customer. This option is useful to share a single dashboard with multiple customers (see [Step 7.3](#step-73-share-the-dashboard)).
 
#### Step 7.1 Create a customer

Let&#39;s create a customer with the title "My New Customer". Please see the instructions below:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step71" showListImageTitles="true" %}

### Step 7.2 Change owner of the device

Let&#39;s assign the Customer as the owner of the device. We will also create a group of devices and add our device to this group.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step72" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Make sure that the device is assigned to your customer.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step72_1" showListImageTitles="true" %}

You can make the customer the owner of the device during its creation stage. To do this, follow this steps:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step72_2" showListImageTitles="true" %}

### Step 7.3 Share the dashboard

Let&#39;s share our dashboard with the customer.
In ThingsBoard, you can&#39;t share an individual dashboard directly — you can only share a dashboard group that contains the dashboard you want to share.
By default, your dashboard is located in the "All" group.
While the recommended approach is to create a dedicated dashboard group and move your dashboard there, for simplicity, we&#39;ll use the existing "All" group in this guide.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step73" showListImageTitles="true" %}

You can also share the dashboard with a customer during its creation:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step73_1" showListImageTitles="true" %}

### Step 7.4 Create a customer user

Now, let&#39;s create a user that will belong to the customer and will have `read-only` access both to the dashboard and the device itself.
You may optionally configure the dashboard to appear just after user logs in to the platform&#39;s web UI.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="step74" showListImageTitles="true" %}

### Step 7.5 Activate the customer user

Finally, log in to ThingsBoard as a customer user.

- Paste the previously copied link into a new browser tab and press the "Enter" key. Now create a password by entering it twice and clicking "Create Password".
- You are now logged in as a customer user. Since this user has read-only access, you can view device data and its alarms, but you cannot acknowledge or clear them.
