- Flexible power options support batteries or DC power supply.

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide, we will need the following:  
{{ prerequisites }}
- [ThingsBoard account]({{ thingsboardHost }}){:target="_blank"} 

## Add device to the network server

LRS10701 uses LoRaWAN technology to send data to the ThingsBoard platform. To start with, you need to configure the LoRaWAN gateway and network server and make sure the data from the sensor can reach the network server. This guide uses ChirpStack open-source LoRaWAN Network Server.

In this guide, we are using a sensor configured as OTAA as an example. To add a device to the network server, you need to the following information:
- Device EUI
- Application EUI
- Application Key

The information is provided on the purchase of the sensor. Contact your sales or distributor for the information if needed.

First, you need to add your device to ChirpStack:

## Create device on ThingsBoard

Follow the guide on [this page](/docs/user-guide/integrations/chirpstack/){:target="_blank"} to create <b>ChirpStack integration</b> on our Thingsboard account and configure integration on your ChirpStack application.

Import the JSON file SENSO8_data_converter_for_chirpstack_integration.json or copy the codes below for the payloadDecoder function.

```js
var deviceType = metadata.deviceProfileName; 
var fPort = metadata.fPort;

/**
Decodes the incoming payload and returns a structured object containing telemetry data and attributes.

@param {byte[]} input - The raw payload received as an array of bytes.
@returns {Object} output - The structured output with decoded telemetry and attributes.

*/

function decodePayload(input) {
 // Initialize the output object with empty attributes and telemetry for clarity. 
 var result = { attributes: {}, telemetry: {}};

 // Decode serial number (SN) from the first 4 bytes of the payload.
  // Press '?' icon in the top right corner to learn more about built in helper functions and capabilities.
  result.attributes.sn = parseBytesToInt(input, 0, 4);

  // Extract the timestamp from metadata (represented in milliseconds).
  var timestamp = metadata.ts; // ts is the timestamp parsed from the incoming message's time, or returns the current time if it cannot be parsed.

  // Initialize an object to store decoded key/value telemetry data.
  var values = {};
  if ((deviceType === 'LRS10701-OTAA') || (deviceType === 'LRS10701-ABP')) {
    if (fPort === 10) {
        // Decode event from the 1st byte of the payload.
        values.event = parseBytesToInt(input, 0, 1);

        // Decode AQI, CO2 and temperature from the 2nd to 5th byte of the payload.
        var AQI_CO2_T = parseBytesToInt(input, 1, 4);
        values.aqi = AQI_CO2_T >> 23;
        values.co2 = (AQI_CO2_T >> 10)&0x1FFF;
        values.temperature = ((AQI_CO2_T & 0x3FF) - 300)*0.1;

        // Decode humidity from the 6th byte of the payload.
        values.humidity = parseBytesToInt(input, 5, 1)*0.5;

        // Decode battery level and EC sensor resolution from the 11th byte of the payload.

        values.gas1 = parseBytesToInt(input, 6, 2)/ec_scale;
        values.gas2 = parseBytesToInt(input, 8, 2)/ec_scale;
      } else if (fPort === 11) {
        // Decode TVOC from the 1st and 2nd byte of the payload.
        values.tvoc = parseBytesToInt(input, 0, 2);

        values["pm2.5"] = parseBytesToInt(input, 5, 3)/1000;
        // Decode PM10 from the 8th to 11th byte of the payload.
        values.pm10 = parseBytesToInt(input, 8, 3)/1000;
      }
  }

  if ((deviceType === 'LRS20100-OTAA') || (deviceType === 'LRS20100-ABP')) {
    if (fPort === 10 && parseBytesToInt(input, 0, 1) === 1) {
        // Decode event from the 2nd byte of the payload.
        values.event = parseBytesToInt(input, 1, 1);

        // Decode temperature from the 4th and 5th byte of the payload.
        var temperature = parseBytesToInt(input, 3, 2);
        if (temperature > 32767) 
            temperature = temperature - 65536;
        values.temperature = temperature/10;

        // Decode humidity from the 6th and 7th byte of the payload.
        values.humidity = parseBytesToInt(input, 5, 2)/10;

        // Decode battery level the 3rd byte of the payload.
        values.battery = parseBytesToInt(input, 2, 1);
    }        
  }

  // Combine the timestamp with values and add it to the telemetry.
  result.telemetry = {
    ts: timestamp,
    values: values
  };

  // Return the fully constructed output object.
  return result;
 
}

var result = decodePayload(payload); 

return result;

After the device has been added to ChirpStack and integration has been setup on both ThingsBoard and ChirpStack, a new device will appear on the ThingBoard user interface when the device sends any data.

## Check data on ThingsBoard

To check the received data, you can go to Devices page under the Entitles. Then select the newly created device from the Device list.

![image](/images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/arwin-technology-limited/lrs20100/lrs20100-10-tb-select_device.png)

The received data can be reviewed on Attributes and Latest telemetry pages.

![image](/images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/arwin-technology-limited/lrs20100/lrs20100-11-tb-receiveddata.png)

ThingsBoard provides a more user-friendly way to visualize your data with dashboards.

ThingsBoard allows you to create and customize your own dashboard to suit your needs.

If you want to experience the dashboard quickly, you can [download this file](/docs/devices-library/resources/dashboards/lrs20100/lrs20100_temperature_and_humidity_sensor_dashboard.json){:target="_blank" download="lrs20100_temperature_and_humidity_sensor_dashboard.json"} and import it to your ThingsBoard to get a glimpse of the dashboard experience.

To import the dashboard, follow these steps:
