## Introduction

[WS202 PIR & Light Sensor]({{deviceVendorLink}}){: target="_blank"} is a PIR sensor based on passive infrared technology to detect a motion or occupancy.  
WS202 can detect whether there is a movement within the range of 6-8 m.  
Besides, WS202 equips with a light sensor which can link PIR detection results to trigger scenes.  
WS202 can be widely used in smart homes, smart offices, schools, warehouses, etc.  
Sensor data are transmitted in real-time using the standard LoRaWAN速 protocol.  
LoRaWAN速 enables encrypted radio transmissions over long distances while consuming very little power.

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide we will need the following:  
{{ prerequisites }}
- [ThingsBoard account]({{ thingsboardHost }}){: target="_blank"}


## Device connection

According to the [official user manual]({{officialManualLink}}){: target="_blank"}, we need a smartphone with NFC enabled and the ToolBox application to connect the sensor.  
Since this device can only be operated using a LoRaWAN速 gateway, we must first connect it to a network server that has an integration configured with ThingsBoard.  
Afterward, it can be provisioned to ThingsBoard.

{% assign articleFilename = page.name |  replace: ".md", "" %}
{% assign guideFilePath = "/docs/devices-library/blocks/ready-to-go-devices/" | append: articleFilename | append: "-configuration-block.md" %}

{% include {{ guideFilePath }} %}

{% endif %}

To configure the device we also need to add it to a network server, so select the network server your gateway is connected to:
