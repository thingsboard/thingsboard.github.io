[Indoor Bluetooth Gateway]({{deviceVendorLink}}){:target="_blank"} is based on Bluetooth 5.0 technology and LoRaWAN.<br>
It receives nearby [Bluetooth beacon](https://www.lansitec.com/products/bluetooth-beacon/){:target="_blank"} messages and transmits them to the server through LoRaWAN. With LoRaWAN technology, there is no network usage fee for long-distance transmission.<br><br>

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide we will need the following:
{{prerequisites}}
- [ThingsBoard account]({{ thingsboardHost }}){: target="_blank"}

## Configuration

Only ThingsBoard Cloud works when using direct communication from this device to ThingsBoard via MQTT.

You may use ThingsBoard PE on-premises or ThingsBoard Cloud when using ThingsBoard Integrations.

To create an integration with a network server please choose first one of the supported network servers:
