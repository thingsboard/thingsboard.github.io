[UG65 LoRaWAN® Gateway]({{deviceVendorLink}}){: target="_blank"} is a robust 8-channel indoor LoRaWAN® gateway. Adopting SX1302 LoRa chip and high-performance quad-core CPU, UG65 supports connection with more than 2000 nodes.  

Key features:  
 - Quad-core industrial processor with big memory  
 - Equip with SX1302 chip, handling a higher amount of traffic with lower consumption  
 - 8 half/full-duplex channels  
 - IP65 enclosure and industrial design for parts of outdoor environment applications like eaves  
 - Desktop, wall, or pole mounting    
 - Multi-backhaul backups with Ethernet, cellular (4G/3G), and Wi-Fi  
 - DeviceHub and Milesight IoT Cloud provide easy and centralized management of remote devices  
 - Enable security communication with multiple VPNs like IPsec/OpenVPN/L2TP/PPTP/DMVPN  
 - Compatible with mainstream network servers like The Things Industries, ChirpStack, etc.  
 - Detect and analyze the noise level and provide an intuitive diagram for deployment  
 - Built-in network server and MQTT/HTTP/HTTPS API for easy integration  
 - Embedded Python SDK for users' secondary development  
 - Fast and user-friendly programming by Node-RED development tool

After doing steps described in this guide you will have a connected and configured gateway on a network server and integration on ThingsBoard, it will allow you to add devices, receive data from them and process a data.

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide we will need the following:  
{{ prerequisites }}
- [ThingsBoard account]({{ thingsboardHost }}){: target="_blank"}

## Gateway connection

According to the [official user manual](https://resource.milesight-iot.com/milesight/document/ug65-user-guide-en.pdf){: target="_blank"} and [this guide](https://support.milesight-iot.com/support/solutions/articles/73000514278-how-to-connect-milesight-gateway-to-the-internet){: target="_blank"} you can connect the gateway to the network and get access to the WebUI in two ways:

- Wireless connection:
  1. Enable Wireless Network Connection on your computer and search for access point “Gateway_******” to connect it.
  2. Open a Web browser on your PC and type in the IP address **192.168.1.1** to access the web GUI.
  3. Enter the username(Default: **admin**) and password(Default: **password**), click **Login**.
  
- Wired connection:
  Connect PC to UG65 Ethernet port directly or through PoE injector to access the web GUI of gateway. The following steps are based on Windows 10 system for your reference.  

  1. Go to “Control Panel” → “Network and Internet” → “Network and Sharing Center”, then click “Ethernet” (May have different names).
  2. Go to “Properties” → “Internet Protocol Version 4(TCP/IPv4)” and select “Use the following IP address”, then assign a static IP manually within the same subnet of the gateway.
  3. Open a Web browser on your PC and type in the IP address **192.168.23.150** to access the web GUI.
  4. Enter the username and password, click “Login”.

        title: Open **Packet Forwarder** in the left menu and save **Gateway EUI** and **Gateway ID**, we will need them to create a gateway on network server.  
'%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=gatewayPacketForwarderTab %}

By default, Gateway EUI and Gateway ID are the same.  

Next steps will describe how to connect the gateway to network server.  

## Configuration

To create an integration with a network server please choose first one of the supported network servers:  

{% assign targetIntegrationTypes = '
ChirpStack,
TheThingsStack,
TheThingsIndustries,
Loriot
