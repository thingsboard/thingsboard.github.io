## Introduction

[The MClimate 16A Switch & Power Meter compact 16A relay and electricity meter]({{deviceVendorLink}}){: target="_blank"} is small enough to fit behind most wall switches and power equipment, enabling you to automate, track, and control your electrical appliances. This is possible as the device has 4 terminals L, N, N, Lout, and it works in a way that connects and disconnects Lout from L. With an overheating protection mechanism, FUOTA (Firmware Upgrades Over The Air), and operation in LoRaWAN Class C, the MClimate 16ASPM is ideal for rapid building retrofitting.

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide we will need the following:  
{{ prerequisites }}
- [ThingsBoard account]({{ thingsboardHost }}){: target="_blank"}


## Device connection

{% if page.hasIntegrationDeviceConfiguration | downcase == "true"%}

{% assign articleFilename = page.name |  replace: ".md", "" %}
{% assign guideFilePath = "/docs/devices-library/blocks/ready-to-go-devices/" | append: articleFilename | append: "-configuration-block.md" %}

{% include {{ guideFilePath }} %}

{% endif %}

To configure the device we also need to add it to a network server, so select the network server your gateway is connected to:  

{% assign targetIntegrationTypes = '
ChirpStack,
TheThingsStack,
TheThingsIndustries,
Loriot
'%}

{% include /docs/devices-library/blocks/basic/thingsboard-add-lorawan-device-through-integration-block.liquid target-integration-types=targetIntegrationTypes %}


## Check data on ThingsBoard

After the device is connected to the network server and ThingsBoard, you can check received and converted data on the platform for this device.  

To do this, open **Entities** menu section and select **Devices**.  
Click on the device name to open the device details page.  
Go to the **Latest telemetry** tab to see the latest telemetry data received from the device.
