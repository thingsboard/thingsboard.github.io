The WEMOS D1 mini is based on a 32-bit ESP8266 microcontroller and has a WiFi module.  
The amount of flash memory of the device reaches 4 MB.  
The improved WEMOS D1 mini model has 16 MB of memory, an SMD antenna, and an output for connecting an external antenna.  
The sizes and location of contacts in both types of boards are the same.
