The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ is currently the best Raspberry Pi computer you can buy. While the price stays at $35, the
new board one-ups its predecessor in several ways, most notably with a faster processor and Wi-Fi. The co-creator of
the board Eben Upton describes it as lying somewhere between the 2016 Raspberry Pi 3 and a future Raspberry Pi 4 in
terms of power and features. The hardware improvements, along with refinements to the Pi 3 B+’s official Raspbian OS,
elevate the board to the status of a perfectly acceptable everyday PC — impressive for a computer the price of a
restaurant meal.
