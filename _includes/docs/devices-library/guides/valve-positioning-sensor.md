[Valve Positioning Sensor]({{deviceVendorLink}}){:target="_blank"} leverages LoRa technology and a built-in magnet sensor to track valve rotation angles with 1Â° accuracy.<br> 
This compact device measures both the direction and total number of turns, reporting real-time data to a LoRaWAN gateway.<br>
With configurable heartbeat intervals and operating modes, plus support for FOTA over Bluetooth, it delivers reliable performance and minimal maintenance in industrial or municipal environments.<br>

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide we will need the following:
{{prerequisites}}
- [ThingsBoard account]({{ thingsboardHost }}){: target="_blank"}

## Configuration

Only ThingsBoard Cloud works when using direct communication from this device to ThingsBoard via MQTT.

You may use ThingsBoard PE on-premises or ThingsBoard Cloud when using ThingsBoard Integrations.

To create an integration with a network server please choose first one of the supported network servers:
