[VIBit]({{deviceVendorLink}}){:target="_blank"} is a compact, rugged, tri-axial vibration, temperature, and acoustic sensor designed for industrial anomaly detection. It supports Wi-Fi connectivity and integrates seamlessly with the MachineAstro VIBit Application for configuration and monitoring.<br><br><br><br><br>

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide, we will need the following:  
- [ThingsBoard account]({{ thingsboardHost }}){: target="_blank"}
{{ prerequisites }}
- MachineAstro VIBit Application installed on a smartphone.
- Wi-Fi network credentials for sensor connectivity.
- MQTT Basic credentials:
  - **Username**: sensor
  - **Password**: cimcon
  - **Client ID**: VIBit Device BLE MAC (Bluetooth MAC address of the sensor)

## Create Device profile on ThingsBoard

First, create a new device profile in ThingsBoard that uses the **MQTT transport** and the standard MQTT topics for telemetry and attributes.

- Log in to your ThingsBoard instance.
- Navigate to **Device profiles** page under the **Profiles** section.
- Click the "**plus**" button, and then select "**Add new device profile**" from drop-down menu.
- Enter **MQTT** as the device profile name.
- Click "**Next: Transport configuration**" button.
- Select **MQTT** as transport type.
- Leave default **MQTT device topic filters**.
- Click **Add** to create device profile.

## Create Device on ThingsBoard

- Navigate to **Devices** page under the **Entities** section.
- Click on "**+**" to add a new device, and then select "**Add new device**" from drop-down menu.
- Enter a name using the VIBit Sensor BLE MAC address (e.g., "F4B3B1A1EFAC").
- Select the previously created **MQTT** device profile in the "Device profile" field.
- Click **Next: Credentials** button.
- On the **Credentials** tab:
    - Select **MQTT Basic** as the credential type.
    - Use the **BLE MAC address of the VIBit device** as the **Client ID**.
    - Enter **sensor** as the **Username**.
    - Enter **cimcon** as the **Password**.
- Click **Add** button to create the device.

## Connect device to ThingsBoard via VIBit Mobile Application

### Prerequisites

- A user must be present on Thingsboard platform.
- VIBit Device must be present on Thingsboard platform.
<br>

- Power on the VIBit sensor.
- Open the VIBit Mobile Application on your smartphone.
- The VIBit mobile application can connect to any ThingsBoard platform by selecting the "**Custom**" option from the drop-down menu and entering either the static public IP address or the HTTPS domain name. Below is one sample image.
