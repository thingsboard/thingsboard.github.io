## Introduction

[M5Stack Timer Camera F](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-cameras/products/esp32-psram-timer-camera-fisheye-ov3660) is a fisheye camera module based on ESP32-D0WDQ6-V3 with 8M PSRAM and 4M Flash on board.  
3.0 megapixel camera (OV3660) with DFOV 120° and a maximum resolution of 2048x1536 photos can be captured.  
The camera features an ultra-low-power design, and the internal integrated RTC (BM8563) draws out the IRQ signal, which can be used for sleep and timer wake-up (sleep current down to 2μA).  
The built-in 270mAh battery provides more than one month of battery life with timed pictures (one per hour) enabled.  
The module supports Wi-Fi image transfer and USB port debugging, and the HY2.0-4P output on the bottom can be used to expand other peripherals.  
The on-board LED status indicator and reset button facilitate program development and debugging.
