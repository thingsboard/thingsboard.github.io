ESP32 PICO KIT is an ESP32-based development board produced by Espressif.  
The development board features a USB-to-UART Bridge circuit which allows developers to connect the board to a computerâ€™s USB port for flashing and debugging.  
Official documentation is available [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-pico-kit-1.html).
