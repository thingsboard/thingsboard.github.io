[SocketSync Proximity Gateway]({{deviceVendorLink}}){:target="_blank"} is equipped with Bluetooth 5.0 and LoRaWAN capabilities. When a [Bluetooth beacon](https://www.lansitec.com/products/bluetooth-beacon/){:target="_blank"} comes into close proximity, the sensor activates buzzing and flashing.<br>
It then transmits the beaconâ€™s ID and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to a LoRaWAN gateway. 
The sensor calculates the distance based on the RSSI between the two devices. Additionally, the proximity sensor functions as a Bluetooth gateway, collecting messages from nearby Bluetooth beacons and forwarding them to the LoRaWAN gateway.<br>
Users can adjust settings such as the alarm range, duration, heartbeat message period, beacon report interval, Bluetooth receiving duration, and message payload size.

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide we will need the following:
{{prerequisites}}
- [ThingsBoard account]({{ thingsboardHost }}){: target="_blank"}

## Configuration

Only ThingsBoard Cloud works when using direct communication from this device to ThingsBoard via MQTT.

You may use ThingsBoard PE on-premises or ThingsBoard Cloud when using ThingsBoard Integrations.

To create an integration with a network server please choose first one of the supported network servers:
