- Enter **MQTT** as the device profile name.
- Click "**Next: Transport configuration**" button.
- Select **MQTT** as transport type.
- Leave default **MQTT device topic filters**.
- Click **Add** to create device profile.

## Connect VIBit-BP Sensor with VIBit-BP BLE Gateway

To enable communication between the VIBit-BP sensor and the VIBit-BP BLE Gateway, follow the configuration process using the iEdge360 interface:

- Connect Laptop and BLE Gateway using Ethernet cable to establish the connection between Gateway and Laptop. Open the iEdge360 platform using default IP (IP: 192.168.1.100, Subnet: 255.255.255.0) and Login with the Credentials shared by the CIMCON Team and navigate to the **Device** tab.

**Note**: Contact CIMCON Support team for the login Credentials.

<br>

<br>

- Click the + icon to add a new device.

![image](/images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/machine-astro/vibit-bp/9.png)

<br>

- In the **Add Device** popup, select **VIBit_BP** as the protocol.

![image](/images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/machine-astro/vibit-bp/10.png)

<br>

- Enter a timeout value (e.g., 60 seconds) and click the check icon to scan for BLE devices.

![image](/images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/machine-astro/vibit-bp/11.png)

<br>

- The discovered VIBit-BP devices will appear in the Devices List along with their MAC addresses.
- Select the required device and click **Save** to register it.
- After device registration, click the **Edit** icon to configure its parameters:
  - Enter sampling rate in seconds.
  - Select the destination as Cloud Integration Name. (e.g., **CIM_Cloud**)
  - Open a UUID section and insert the Device ID, which was copied from ThingsBoard. (It's a device id exists on Thingbsoard)Â

## Integrate BLE Gateway with ThingsBoard

- In iEdge360, go to the "**Integration** tab.

![image](/images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/machine-astro/vibit-bp/14.png)

- Click the "**+**" icon and select **CIM_Cloud** as the transport.

![image](/images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/machine-astro/vibit-bp/15.png)

- Provide a name (e.g., Thingsboard) and click **Save**.
- In the newly created CIM_Cloud transport, enter:
  - MQTT Port (e.g., 1883)
  - Endpoint (e.g., ThingsBoard IP)
  - Auth type: MQTT Basic or MQTT X.509 (Select MQTT Basic or MQTT X.509 based on the device created in Thingsboard)
  - **Client ID** (match with BLE MAC)
  - **User**: sensor
  - **Password**: cimcon

![image](/images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/machine-astro/vibit-bp/16.png)

- Configure incoming and outgoing messages:
  - Incoming: Topic v1/devices/me/attribute, Type Attribute
  - Outgoing: Topic v1/devices/me/telemetry (for Data), v1/devices/me/attribute (for Attribute)

This completes the setup to stream sensor data securely from the BLE gateway to ThingsBoard.

## Check Data on ThingsBoard

- In ThingsBoard, navigate to the "**Devices**" section and select your VIBit-BP device.
- Access the "**Latest telemetry**" tab and Wake-up the VIBit-BP Sensor using Magnet for quick view or wait for the configured telemetry frequency to view real-time data such as:
  - 3-axis acceleration and velocity RMS
  - 3-axis acceleration and velocity FFT
  - Temperature readings
