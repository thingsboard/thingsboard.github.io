![{{deviceName}}](/images/devices-library/{{page.deviceImageFileName}}){: style="float: left; max-width: 200px; max-height: 200px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px"}
The [reComputer R1100]({{deviceVendorLink}}){: target="_blank"}, powered by Raspberry Pi CM4, is an adaptable edge IoT gateway with AI capabilities. 
It features comprehensive industrial interfaces (2x Ethernet, 2xUSB, 2xRS485, 2xRS232, 2xDI and 2xDO) and flexible wireless connectivity options (4G, LoRa®, Wi-Fi/BLE), making it ideal for diverse industrial applications

It has extensive applications in the IoT field. It can be used in aspects such as data acquisition and process monitoring, automation and robot control, intelligent manufacturing, and industrial communication and networking. 
With its small size, flexibility, low cost, and programmability, it provides strong support for automation & IoT system and more.

## Configuring the ModBus Connector

The new **IoT Gateway device** will be featured at the top of the **“ThingsBoard IoT Gateways”** dashboard list, allowing us to add a **ModBus Connector**. For example, we can use the ModBus Connector to fetch temperature data from the to fetch temperature data from the [Siemens LOGO!]({{controllerVendorLink}}){: target="_blank"} device:

## Installing the ThingsBoard IoT Gateway on the reComputer R1100

Start installation of the **IoT Gateway** on the **reComputer R1100**:

{% else %}  
    {% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=downloadYMLCE %}
{% endif %}

* Then, open another tab in the terminal and initiate the **SSH** connection to the **reComputer R1100**:

```bash
ssh recomputer@ip_address
```
{: .copy-code}

**ip_address:** The IP address of the reComputer R1100. Enter the actual IP address instead of _ip_address_.<br>
**Password:** Terminal requests the password. _The **default password** for the reComputer R1100 is: 12345678_

* Create the directory for the Gateway service:

```bash
mkdir gateway_service
```
{: .copy-code}

* Open this directory:

```bash
cd /home/recomputer/gateway_service
```
{: .copy-code}

* Create the docker compose file for your **IoT Gateway**:

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```
{: .copy-code}

* Copy the content of the previously downloaded **docker-compose.yml** file, and paste it into the new one via the terminal:

![image](/images/devices-library/edge/recomputer-r1100/copy-paste-configs.webp)

* Save the **docker-compose.yml** file and press **CTRL+S** to save it. To close the file press **CTRL+X**.

* Start the **Gateway** by executing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
```
{: .copy-code}

{% capture local-deployment %}
The command must be executed in the same directory in which the docker-compose.yml file was saved.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=local-deployment %}
