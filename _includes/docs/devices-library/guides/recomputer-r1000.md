The [reComputer R1000]({{deviceVendorLink}}){: target="_blank"} edge IoT controller is built on the high-performance Raspberry Pi CM4 platform, featuring a quad-core A72 processor with a maximum support of 8GB RAM and 32GB eMMC. Equipped with dual Ethernet interfaces that can be flexibly configured, it also includes 3 isolated RS485 channels supporting BACnet, Modbus RTU, Modbus TCP/IP protocols. With robust IoT network communication capabilities, the R1000 series supports multiple wireless communication options including 4G, LoRa®, Wi-Fi/BLE, allowing for flexible configurations to serve as corresponding wireless gateways. This controller is well-suited for remote device management, energy management, and various other scenarios in the field of smart buildings.

## Configuring the ModBus Connector

The new **IoT Gateway device** will be featured at the top of the **“ThingsBoard IoT Gateways”** dashboard list, allowing us to add a **ModBus Connector**. For example, we can use the ModBus Connector to fetch temperature data from the to fetch temperature data from the [Siemens LOGO!]({{controllerVendorLink}}){: target="_blank"} device:

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=downloadYMLPE %}
{% else %}  
{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=downloadYMLCE %}
{% endif %}

* Then, open another tab in the terminal and initiate the **SSH** connection to the **reComputer R1000**:

```bash
ssh recomputer@ip_address
```
{: .copy-code}

**ip_address:** The IP address of the reComputer R1000. Enter the actual IP address instead of _ip_address_.<br>
**Password:** Terminal requests the password. The **default password** for the reComputer R1000 is: 12345678

* Create the directory for the Gateway service:

```bash
mkdir gateway_service
```
{: .copy-code}

* Open this directory:

```bash
cd /home/recomputer/gateway_service
```
{: .copy-code}

* Create the docker compose file for your **IoT Gateway**:

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```
{: .copy-code}

* Copy the content of the previously downloaded **docker-compose.yml** file, and paste it into the new one via the terminal:

![image](/images/devices-library/edge/recomputer-r1000/10-copy-paste-configs.webp)

* Save the **docker-compose.yml** file and press **CTRL+S** to save it. To close the file press **CTRL+X**.

* Start the **Gateway** by executing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
```
{: .copy-code}

{% capture local-deployment %}
The command must be executed in the same directory in which the docker-compose.yml file was saved.
{% endcapture %}
{% include templates/info-banner.md content=local-deployment %}
