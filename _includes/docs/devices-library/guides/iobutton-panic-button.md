## Introduction

[ioButton Panic button]({{deviceVendorLink}}){: target="_blank"} ioButton is a versatile solution, pre-
configured for various emergency
scenarios. When the panic button is
activated, users receive immediate
notification through the prominent LED
ring, accompanied by haptic feedback
from the vibration motor. With a standard battery life of over 10 years, virtually no maintenance is required. 
The ioButton can send 1,000,000 messages on SF-7 and 100,000 on SF-12!
By default, the ioButton sends a heartbeat message every 4 hours.

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide we will need the following:  
{{ prerequisites }}
- [ThingsBoard account]({{ thingsboardHost }}){: target="_blank"}


## Device connection

{% if page.hasIntegrationDeviceConfiguration | downcase == "true"%}

{% assign articleFilename = page.name |  replace: ".md", "" %}
{% assign guideFilePath = "/docs/devices-library/blocks/ready-to-go-devices/" | append: articleFilename | append: "-configuration-block.md" %}

{% include {{ guideFilePath }} %}

{% endif %}

To configure the device we also need to add it to a network server, so select the network server your gateway is connected to:  

{% assign targetIntegrationTypes = '
ChirpStack,
TheThingsStack,
TheThingsIndustries,
Loriot
'%}

{% include /docs/devices-library/blocks/basic/thingsboard-add-lorawan-device-through-integration-block.liquid target-integration-types=targetIntegrationTypes %}


## Check data on ThingsBoard

After the device is connected to the network server and ThingsBoard, you can check received and converted data on the platform for this device.  

To do this, open **Entities** menu section and select **Devices**.  
Click on the device name to open the device details page.  
Go to the **Latest telemetry** tab to see the latest telemetry data received from the device.
