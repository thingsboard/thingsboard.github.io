[The KNX IP Multi IO 580 (48I/O)](https://weinzierl.de/en/products/knx-ip-multi-io-580/){:target="_blank"} is a universal binary interface for building control. It provides 48 I/O lines. Each line can be used as binary input as well as binary output. The peripherals can be fed by an external voltage of 24 V⎓. Channels which are configured as inputs can be used to control lights or blinds via the KNX network. They also can be used to count impulses, e.g. as interface for energy meters. Channels which are configured as outputs can directly drive signal LEDs, external coupling relays.<br><br>

%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=KnxIpMultiScreenshot2 %}

### Adding group addresses

To read data from the Weinzierl KNX IP Multi IO 580 (48I/O) after configuring, we need to configure the appropriate **Group Addresses** in the **ETS** software, for this purpose, use the following steps:

{% assign KnxIpMultiScreenshot3 = '
    ===
        image: /images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/knx-ip-multi-io/knx-ip-multi-io-screenshot-9.png,

        title: Select "Shutter Actuator" for "**Channel function 1**", "**Switching Actuator**" for "**Channel function 2**" and "**Channel function 3**". You can find added Group Objects in the "**Group Objects**" tab.
'
%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=KnxIpMultiScreenshot4 %}

The last thing that we need to do is set group objects ability to read and write, and link them with group addresses. For this purpose, use the following steps:

- In the "Group Objects" tab click on first group object and in the right sidebar in the section "Flags" enable Write and Read. Repeat this actions for the rest group objects.
- In the "Group Objects" tab right click on first group object (Jalousie 1: Drive stop) and select "Link with…" button.
- In the opened modal window click on "…" button, in the opened window select "0/0/4" group address. Repeat this action for the rest group objects using the following table:

| **Group Object Name**   | **Group Address** |
|:------------------------|:------------------|
| Jalousie 1: Drive stop  | 0/0/4             |
| Jalousie 1: Drive start | 0/0/3             |
| Actuator 3: Output      | 0/0/2             |
| Actuator 2: Output      | 0/0/1             |
| ---
