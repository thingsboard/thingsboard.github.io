The WeMos D1 board, developed by WeMos company, is based on the ESP8266 ESP-12 WiFi module.  
Board programming is carried out using the standard Arduino IDE development environment.  
The controller includes a processor, peripherals, RAM and input/output devices.  
Most often, microcontrollers are used in computer equipment, household appliances and other electronic devices.  
WeMos is distinguished by its low cost and ease of connection and programming.
