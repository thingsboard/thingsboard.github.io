The NodeMCU is quite a popular development board that is broadly implemented across the internet world.   
It is based on the ESP-12E Wi-Fi module that is perfectly associated with the combination of easy programming elements with Arduino IDE as well as Wi-Fi capability.  
The prototyping and development projects can be handled smoothly via the inbuilt programmer and CP2102 USB-to-serial chip that flashes the ESP8266 and serial output on PC integration.
The NodeMCU development board integrates ESP8266.  It is a well-integrated chip that is specifically crafted to cater to the requirements of a new connected world.  
The unit allows to either host the application or to offload all Wi-Fi networking functions derived from another application processing unit.
