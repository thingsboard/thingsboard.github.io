The whole configuration of Efento sensors is done with a free mobile application for Android.  
Application can be downloaded from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.efento.cloud&hl=en).  
Before you start configuration make sure the sensor is able to register in the NB-IoT network and the APN settings are right. 
Detailed user manual of Efento NB-IoT sensors and Efento mobile application can be found in the [support section of Efento website](https://getefento.com/support/).
