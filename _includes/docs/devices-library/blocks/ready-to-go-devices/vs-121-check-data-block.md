To check it you may open "Devices" page in "Entities" section. 
The device should be in devices list. You can check the data by clicking the device and navigate to the "**Attributes**" or "**Latest telemetry**" tab.

{% assign checkTelemetryOnDevice = '

In order to get more user-friendly view - you can use [dashboard](/docs/pe/user-guide/dashboards){: target="_blank"}.
Download a simple dashboard for this device. It is configured to display a data from "Count people all", "Max count people", "Signal strength", "Region count" and "Occupancy" timeseries keys of device with name "eui-24e124538b223213".

{% include /docs/devices-library/blocks/basic/thingsboard-upload-example-dashboard.md exampleDashboardPath="/docs/devices-library/resources/dashboards/ready-to-go-devices/vs-121-sensor-dashboard.json" %}  

To open the imported dashboard, click on it. Then you should specify your device in entity alias of the dashboard.

To do this, follow these steps:

{% assign editAlias = '
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/dashboards/alias/edit-alias-for-vs-121-sensor-1-pe.png,
        title: Open the dashboard and enter edit mode. Click the "Entity aliases" icon, then in the pop-up window click the "Edit alias" icon next to the alias.
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/dashboards/alias/edit-alias-for-vs-121-sensor-2-pe.png,
        title: In edit alias window select your device from dropdown list and save entity alias.
    ===
        image: /images/user-guide/dashboards/alias/edit-alias-for-vs-121-sensor-3-pe.png,
        title: Apply all changes.
'
%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=editAlias %}

Now you should be able to see the data from the device.
