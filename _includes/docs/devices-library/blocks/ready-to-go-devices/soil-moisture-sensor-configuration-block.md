### Device configuration

To connect and send data we should configure the device and network server.  
First, we are going to configure the device and save the required information for the network server configuration.  
To add a device to the network server and retrieve data from it, you will need the following device parameters:

- **Device EUI** – Device identifier
- **Application EUI** – Application identifier
- **Application Key** – Application key for device authentication

> **Note:** You can find the values of these keys on the label located on the side of the device (see example image below).
