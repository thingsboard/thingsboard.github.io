### Device Configuration

To connect and send data, we need to configure both the **device** and the **network server**.

First, let's configure the device and gather the necessary information for the network server. To add a device to the network server and receive data from it, you'll need these device parameters:

* **Device EUI (DevEUI)**: The unique device identifier. You'll find this on a sticker on the back of your sensor.
* **Application EUI (JoinEUI)**: The application identifier.
* **Application Key (AppKey)**: The application key used to authenticate the device.

The AppKey and JoinEUI are unique to each customer and are sent individually after your sensors are shipped or received.
