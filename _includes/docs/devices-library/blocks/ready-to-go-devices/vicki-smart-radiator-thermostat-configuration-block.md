### Device configuration

To connect and send data we should configure the device and network server.  
At first we are going to configure the device, and save required information for network server configuration.  
To add a device to network server and get information from it, we will need the following device parameters:
- **Device EUI** – device identifier
- **Application EUI** – Application identifier
- **Application Key** – Application key to identify device

**Note:** You can get EUI, AppEUI (JoinEUI) and AppKey information from the LoRaWAN® credentials .csv file. This file is delivered to your email upon order completion.
