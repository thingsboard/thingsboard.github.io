Trigger the transmission in order to check if the device sends the data to your ThingsBoard instance.  
Click on the menu (three dots in the upper right corner -> Trigger transmission.  
If everything is set correctly, you should see the data in ThingsBoard, to do this:  

{% assign checkEfentoSensorData = '
    ===
        image: /images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/wireless-open-close-sensor/check-device-data.png,
        title: Click on the device and the most recent data from the device will be visible in the “Latest telemetry” tab.
'
%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="false" imageCollection=checkEfentoSensorData %}

{% capture effento-offer %}

**Important!**  
For orders over 250 devices Efento can pre-configure the devices for you, so they will send the data to your ThingsBoard instance out-of-the-box and no configuration will be required on the sensor side.  
Efento will provide you with a csv file, which allows you easily add and [provision all the devices at once](/docs/{{page.docsPrefix}}user-guide/bulk-provisioning/) on ThingsBoard instance.
