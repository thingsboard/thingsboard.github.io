### Configure the gateway to send data

To connect and send data to The Things Stack Community Edition we should configure the gateway.  
To do this please follow next steps:  
{% assign connectGatewayToNS = '
    ===
        image: /images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/milesight-lorawan-gateway/general-settings-view.png,
        title: Open gateway control panel.
    ===
        image: /images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/milesight-lorawan-gateway/ns-configuration-before.png,
        title: Click on **plus** button, to add a new forwarder.
    ===
        image: /images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/milesight-lorawan-gateway/ns-tts-configuration-window.png,
        title: Put into **Server address** your server address, in our case it is **eu1.cloud.thethings.network**
    ===
        image: /images/devices-library/ready-to-go-devices/milesight-lorawan-gateway/ns-configuration-after.png,
        title: Press **Save** button.
'
%}

{% include images-gallery.liquid showListImageTitles="true" imageCollection=connectGatewayToNS %}

Now, the gateway is able to send a data to the network server.
