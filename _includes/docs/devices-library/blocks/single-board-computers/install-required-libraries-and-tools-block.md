To install the `thingsboard-python-client-sdk`, use the command below.
We recommend installing packages outside the global environment:

```bash
pip3 install tb-mqtt-client
```
{:.copy-code}

Also, you should have tools that allow editing code. 
For example, you can use the Nano editor, which comes pre-installed, or install any other code editor you prefer.
