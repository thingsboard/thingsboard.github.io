You should have installed thingsboard-python-client-sdk which can be installed using the following command. Still, we recommend installing packages outside the global environment:

```bash
pip3 install tb-mqtt-client
```
{:.copy-code}

Also, you should have tools that allow editing code, for example, you can use Nano editor that is going out of the box or install any other code editor you are familiar with.
