## Introduction

[Milesight VS121]({{deviceVendorLink}}){: target="_blank"}, is an AI workplace sensor designed to monitor occupancy and utilization in modern workspaces, which can reach up to 98% recognition rate based on its AI algorithm. 
Milesight VS121 is available in dual versions that transmit data through LoRaWAN® or Ethernet for different applications. Based on standard Lorawan protocol, VS121 can work with the Milesight gateway. 
It is equipped with WI-FI for easy configuration without the need for any additional configuration tools. By connecting this device to the ThingsBoard, you can get improved visualization and data management capabilities.

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide we will need the following:  
{{ prerequisites }}
- [ThingsBoard account]({{ thingsboardHost }}){: target="_blank"}


## Device connection

According to the [official user manual]({{officialManualLink}}){: target="_blank"} and this guide, you can connect the device  to the network and get access to the Web UI via wireless connection.
Since this device can only be operated using a LoRaWAN® gateway, we must first connect it to a network server that has an integration configured with ThingsBoard.

{% assign guideFilePath = "/docs/device-library/blocks/ready-to-go-devices/" | append: articleFilename | append: "-configuration-block.md" %}

{% include {{ guideFilePath }} %}

{% endif %}

To configure the device we also need to add it to a network server, so select the network server your gateway is connected to:
