[Valve Positioning Sensor]({{deviceVendorLink}}){:target="_blank"} leverages LoRa technology and a built-in magnet sensor to track valve rotation angles with 1° accuracy.<br> 
This compact device measures both the direction and total number of turns, reporting real-time data to a LoRaWAN gateway.<br>
With configurable heartbeat intervals and operating modes, plus support for FOTA over Bluetooth, it delivers reliable performance and minimal maintenance in industrial or municipal environments.<br>
