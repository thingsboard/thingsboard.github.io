## Introduction

[AgroSense LoRaWAN® Soil Moisture Sensor]({{deviceVendorLink}}){: target="_blank"} measures the Humidity at the range of 12-bit ADC, -40℃ to 85℃with capacitive method ，also with highly waterproof performance tested to IP68, making it widely applicable in agricultural environmental sensing scenarios to support the smart agricultural production.

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide we will need the following:  
{{ prerequisites }}
- [ThingsBoard account]({{ thingsboardHost }}){: target="_blank"}



## Device connection

{% if page.hasIntegrationDeviceConfiguration | downcase == "true"%}

{% assign articleFilename = page.name |  replace: ".md", "" %}
{% assign guideFilePath = "/docs/device-library/blocks/ready-to-go-devices/" | append: articleFilename | append: "-configuration-block.md" %}

{% include {{ guideFilePath }} %}

{% endif %}

To configure the device we also need to add it to a network server, so select the network server your gateway is connected to:  

{% assign targetIntegrationTypes = '
ChirpStack,
TheThingsStack,
TheThingsIndustries,
Loriot
'%}

{% include /docs/device-library/blocks/basic/thingsboard-add-lorawan-device-through-integration-block.liquid target-integration-types=targetIntegrationTypes %}


## Check data on ThingsBoard

After the device is connected to the network server and ThingsBoard, you can check received and converted data on the platform for this device.  

To do this, open **Entities** menu section and select **Devices**.  
Click on the device name to open the device details page.  
Go to the **Latest telemetry** tab to see the latest telemetry data received from the device.
