            <h2>How IoT monitoring system works?</h2>
            <div class="text-content small-margin">First step is to select devices that can collect and report required measurements. They selected based on properties of the iot monitoring system or process that should be monitored.</div>
            <div class="text-content medium-margin">Next step is to connect iot devices to the monitoring application using one of supported protocols - MQTT, HTTP, LoraWAN, OPC-UA, CoAP, LwM2M and others. Full list of supported protocols available in <a class="article-link" href="/docs/pe/api/">ThingsBoard API reference</a> or on our <a class="article-link" href="/docs/pe/guides/#AnchorIDConnectYourDevice">connectivity guides</a>.</div>
            <div class="text-content medium-margin">Once device connected and reports data to the platform, incoming telemetry saved in the database, we can build real time and historical monitoring dashboards using <a class="article-link" href="/docs/pe/guides/#AnchorIDDataVisualization">IoT dashboard development guide</a>.</div>
            <div class="text-content medium-margin">Dashboard should have drill down navigation to start from the high-level system overview and go to lover levels to understand current system state and analyze historical data</div>
            <h2>What is End-to-End IoT Performance Visibility?</h2>
            <div class="text-content small-margin">IoT monitoring solution gives end to end visibility of remote system. It means that all aspects of system behavior, including current, historical and future are available for operators in real time from remote locations. With this data operators can understand system better, optimize it, perform root cause analysis and prevent potential bottlenecks. Data from IoT sensors used to monitor system in realtime. Analysis of data trends using ML/AI models identifies and highlight components that might fail or require maintenance. For sites where safety and security compliance is critical, real time iot alerts and data logging ensure safety and regulation compliance.</div>
            <h2>IoT Monitoring Tools</h2>
            <h3>What types of devices are used for data collection</h3>
            <div class="text-content small-margin">We can split iot devices into few categories based on their characteristics:</div>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><span class="bold-text">Power source:</span> it can be devices with internal batteries and in this case we need to think about energy effectiveness to reduce battery replacement frequencies. We can do that by selecting energy efficient networking and communication protocols, data update frequency and payload size. Opposite to that there big device category that uses external power sources (grid, renewable energy, etc). Relatively new and small category - Passive IoT devices that do not require energy source to transfer data from sensor to iot system. Most common technologies in this domain are RFID tags and NFC.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Connectivity type:</span> long range low power devices can send data for long distances and consume really small amount of energy  (LPWAN - LoraWAN, NB-IoT, etc). Wireless connectivity - it includes short range coverage network (BLE, Bluetooth, WiFi, ZigBee, etc) and country-wide coverage (4G/5G, satellite, etc). Wired connection - used when devices communicate with IoT system via wire (Ethernet, Modbus, OPC-UA and others)</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="text-content small-margin">There are other categorization options, for example by device functions - sensors, actuators, controllers or by industry - Industrial equipment, smart home, healthcare, automotive, energy management, logistic.</div>
            <h3>What type of data IoT devices usually collect?</h3>
            <div class="text-content small-margin">In general, IoT device and sensors collect and measure physical characteristic of environment or objects they monitor. Also, IoT devices can report state of the system, process or hardware they control. Depends on business domain, Energy management/BEMS - energy consumption, voltage and other electric characteristic. In Industrial IoT monitoring it can be data from PLCs and sensors installed on equipment and factory floor - vibration, pressure, status code, errors, production pace, etc. It can also be temperature, humidity, occupancy, lighting, battery level, rssi and much more. If we are talking about gateways and edge services that are part of IoT system, we can monitor RAM, CPU and disk usage of those systems as well as network parameters.</div>
            <h3>3 ways of telemetry collection</h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><span class="bold-text">Option 1:</span> IoT Devices has multiple built-in sensors and they report this telemetry with predefined frequency (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc).</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Option 2:</span> Data loggers do not have built-in sensors but know where and how to take data that needs to be monitored. For example, they can collect data via modbus, analog ports, CAN, etc.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Option 3:</span> PLCs - controllers installed in various equipment to control and monitor it. They can collect and report required telemetry, status change or notify about events.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>IoT data visualization and notification</h3>
            <div class="text-content small-margin">Large IoT solutions, where thousands devices are connected it is not possible to monitor and tack each device individually. Business want to be notified when some devices required attention. For example user want to receive notification when battery level is critical and set a threshold equal to 3.1V. In this case IoT application would compare current battery level with threshold value and send an alert with configured notification channel to responsible user. Thingsboard supports such case with notification center and configurable alarm rules.</div>
            <h2>What is edge computing?</h2>
            <div class="text-content small-margin">Edge computing used to speedup data processing by transferring processing logic from central cloud to the edge closer to the data collection devices. Also, less amount of data transferred from devices to the cloud decrease system costs and pressure on network. ThingsBoard has edge product (https://thingsboard.io/products/thingsboard-edge/) it allows to provision, configure and control multiple edge installations. ThingsBoard cloud act like a central configuration point, where user define processing logic, data retention policy, workflows, visualization dashboards and deploy it on edge systems. On the edge ThingsBoard communicate with local devices/sensors process their data and report required portion of it to the cloud.</div>
            <h2>IoT security monitoring detailed explanation</h2>
            <div class="text-content medium-margin">There are 3 vectors how to secure IoT applications:</div>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Physical security - prevent unauthorised users to get physical access to the IoT device and change its configuration or inject malfunctions inside it.</li>
                <li>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks - to prevent external cyberattack on IoT infrastructure exploiting software vulnerabilities we need to secure communication channels with encryption and perform regular firmware and software updates to close security gaps that attackers might exploit.</li>
                <li>Configure user role based access control with clear defined permissions and secured authentication mechanism. It includes configurable data visibility and permissions for application users, audit logs, user session management, multifactor authorization and password protection.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Basics of an IoT Device Management Dashboard</h2>
