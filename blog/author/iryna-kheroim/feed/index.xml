										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction&nbsp;</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Equipment in production plays an important role in achieving maximum efficiency, quality, and payback. The issues that are key to optimizing the use of equipment are:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Underutilization of Equipment</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Ineffective Production Scheduling</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Excessive Wear and Tear on Machinery</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Operational Bottlenecks</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Suboptimal Maintenance Scheduling</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Misaligned Capacity Planning</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solving these problems requires constant monitoring of equipment utilization and performance metrics. As production output increases, manufacturers may need to partially or completely change their equipment maintenance strategies and schedules to maintain efficiency. Unfortunately, these problems cannot be solved once and for all. But it also means that we can endlessly improve the optimization process.&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">That is why having the most up-to-date data is important when choosing an optimization strategy. Previously, with the help of logging, you could see how the equipment worked at the end of the day or week. With the growth of technology and the help of IoT devices, we can receive raw data in real-time. With advanced analytics, you can turn raw data into meaningful reports and predict future equipment behavior using machine learning models.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Equipment Utilization</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">To understand the overall condition of the equipment, you need to operate with a significant number of KPIs. We have divided KPIs by the problems they solve:</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><em>Underutilization of Equipment and Operational Bottlenecks</em></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Production Output &#8211; A numerical or quality indicator of the useful action performed by the equipment. The information is collected using counters, scales, or quality sensors transmitted via the network to the ThingsBoard. The data does not require any additional processing.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Equipment Utilization Rate &#8211; measures the degree to which equipment is utilized over a period compared to its full potential or capacity. Production Output is taken as the current capacity indicator. The maximum capacity is set according to the technical documentation. The indicator is calculated by an analytics system that finds the ratio of Production Output to Maximum Capacity in real-time.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="2409" height="1485" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Equipment-Utilization-Rate.webp" alt="Block with percentage statistics and small chart" class="wp-image-3776" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Equipment-Utilization-Rate.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Equipment-Utilization-Rate-300x185.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Equipment-Utilization-Rate-1024x631.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Equipment-Utilization-Rate-768x473.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Equipment-Utilization-Rate-1536x947.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Equipment-Utilization-Rate-2048x1262.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Equipment-Utilization-Rate-512x316.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Equipment-Utilization-Rate-920x567.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Equipment-Utilization-Rate-1600x986.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Equipment-Utilization-Rate-1920x1184.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Percentage of defects &#8211; The number of defects concerning the Production Output. Defective products are automatically detected using computer vision, ultrasonic or X-ray inspection, or by using manual inspection. The advanced analytics system calculates it in real-time by comparing the number of defective products to the manufactured product.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="638" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Precentage-of-Defects-1024x638.webp" alt="Grid which shows percentage of defects " class="wp-image-3777" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Precentage-of-Defects-1024x638.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Precentage-of-Defects-300x187.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Precentage-of-Defects-768x478.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Precentage-of-Defects-1536x956.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Precentage-of-Defects-2048x1275.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Precentage-of-Defects-512x319.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Precentage-of-Defects-920x573.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Precentage-of-Defects-1600x996.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Precentage-of-Defects-1920x1196.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Precentage-of-Defects.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><em>Ineffective Production Scheduling</em></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Throughput &#8211; Measuring the rate at which products are produced on a machine, line, plant, or across the entire company. Throughput is calculated from meters installed at the inlet and outlet of each production line. After that, the advanced analytics system converts the raw data of time indicators into a ready-made report of the time it took the equipment to perform a certain action.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Time-Based Measurement &#8211; tracks how long the equipment is actively used during a defined period, such as a shift or a day. This measurement is crucial as it reveals the actual usage versus the potential capacity, highlighting whether the equipment is being underutilized or overused. Information is collected using IoT devices or functions built into the equipment. After that, raw time data is translated into a ready-made KPI indicator using advanced analytics.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="641" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-1024x641.webp" alt="Grid which shows how long the equipment is actively used during a defined period" class="wp-image-3779" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-1024x641.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-300x188.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-768x481.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-1536x962.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-2048x1283.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-512x321.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-920x576.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-1600x1002.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-1920x1203.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><em>Excessive Wear and Tear on Machinery and Suboptimal Maintenance Scheduling</em></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Downtime and Uptime </strong>&#8211;&nbsp; Uptime refers to the duration when the equipment is running and available for use, directly contributing to productivity. Downtime, on the other hand, represents periods when the equipment is non-operational due to maintenance, breakdowns, or other issues. These metrics are crucial for understanding the reliability and efficiency of equipment. Information is collected using IoT devices or functions built into the equipment. The data does not require any additional processing.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)</strong> &#8211; This measures the average time it takes to repair equipment after a failure. A lower MTTR helps in reducing downtime and maintaining productivity.&nbsp; This indicator uses the same metrics for calculation as the Downtime and Uptime KPIs. After collecting the data, the advanced analytics system calculates the average value among the time indicators and provides a ready-made report.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) &#8211; This KPI measures the average time between equipment failures. A higher MTBF indicates more reliable equipment. This indicator uses the same metrics for calculation as the Downtime and Uptime KPIs. After collecting the data, the advanced analytics system calculates the average value among the time indicators and provides a ready-made report.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Based on the indicators, this method helps to track production and has more opportunities to react proactively or to problems. Thus, the use of advanced analytics gives us access to:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Maximizing Efficiency:</strong> Companies can identify underused resources by measuring how much equipment is used compared to its full potential. This helps make adjustments to increase efficiency, ensuring that the equipment is not just sitting idle when it could contribute to production.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Equipment represents a significant investment for any business. Measuring its utilization helps understand whether the company is getting the most out of this investment. If equipment isn&#8217;t used effectively, it could lead to unnecessary expenses like paying for machines that aren&#8217;t contributing to revenue generation.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Improving Production Planning:</strong> Equipment utilization data is crucial for effective production scheduling. It helps align the use of machinery with production demands, ensuring that the right equipment is available and operational when needed.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Reducing Wear and Tear:</strong> Overuse of equipment can lead to increased maintenance needs and shorter lifespans for machinery. By monitoring utilization, companies can balance the workload on equipment to prevent excessive wear and tear.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Identifying Bottlenecks:</strong> Low utilization rates can signal bottlenecks where equipment is not used effectively in production. This can lead to insights about process inefficiencies or the need to reallocate resources.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Maintenance Scheduling:</strong> Knowing how frequently and intensely equipment is used informs maintenance schedules. Instead of following a rigid maintenance calendar, companies can plan maintenance based on actual usage, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The exploration of advanced analytics in equipment utilization underscores a transformative shift in optimizing manufacturing processes. By integrating real-time data collection through IoT devices with the analytical power of advanced analytics and machine learning, production facilities are equipped to make more informed, proactive decisions. This approach revolutionizes equipment management by providing a deeper and more accurate understanding of various key performance indicators (KPIs) like Equipment Utilization Rate, Throughput, Downtime and Uptime, MTTR, and MTBF.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The implications of this evolution are far-reaching. Advanced analytics enables a more dynamic approach to addressing challenges like underutilization, inefficient production scheduling, and excessive wear and tear on machinery. It allows for real-time identification of operational bottlenecks and facilitates more strategic maintenance scheduling, thereby extending the lifespan of equipment and optimizing investment returns.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Furthermore, the capacity to predict and preempt equipment failures through these sophisticated analytical tools enhances operational efficiency and significantly reduces costs. This proactive equipment maintenance and optimization approach ensures that resources are utilized effectively, reducing wastage and downtime.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">In conclusion, integrating advanced analytics into equipment utilization is not just an enhancement of existing processes; it&#8217;s a fundamental shift towards a more data-driven, efficient, and productive manufacturing environment.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Solar power plants face issues due to temperature and environmental factors, which lead to reduced efficiency and potential&#8230;</p>
<p>The post <a href="/blog/optimizing-solar-parks-efficiency-advanced-anomaly-detection-solutions/">Optimizing solar parks efficiency – advanced anomaly detection solutions</a> first appeared on <a href="/blog/">Thingsboard's blog</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:16px">Solar power plants face issues due to temperature and environmental factors, which lead to reduced efficiency and potential major breakdowns if not addressed quickly. The challenge is that monitoring tools like drones, digital multimeters, and infrared cameras are costly, making regular checks infrequent, which does not allow quick responses to problems. This means that if a problem arises after a maintenance check, electricity production efficiency will fall, leading to significant losses.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>The ability to quickly respond to problems</strong>&nbsp;is what plants with constant energy production need.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">One of the ways to achieve a quick response to problems is through the use of anomaly detection. Using this method provides an opportunity to respond to problems quickly and significantly reduces the spending on third-party equipment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-1024x574.webp" alt="Thingsboard dashboard with chart and two tables with lists of alarms and annomaly situations" class="wp-image-3765" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-1024x574.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-300x168.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-768x430.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-1536x861.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-2048x1148.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-512x287.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-920x516.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-1600x897.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems-1920x1076.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-ability-to-quickly-respond-to-problems.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Anomaly detection is a technique to identify patterns or events deviating from the norm. In the context of a solar farm, this can involve monitoring various factors, such as Real-time Energy Output, Power Generation Trends, Solar Irradiance, and Temperature for Solar Panels. Also Output Voltage and Current, Frequency, Efficiency, Temperature for Inverter. By analyzing this data, anomaly detection algorithms can identify unusual patterns or events that may indicate problems before they can do any damage to the solar panel or inverter. In other words, we look for a problem not when we see that energy is produced less than expected for the second day in a row but right at the moment when the problem appeared.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">But, unusual patterns are not just deviations of parameters from the norm.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Unusual patterns are combinations of parameters that are not expected but which identify potential problems. They are discovered by analyzing historical data collected from solar panels and inverters. During this analysis, we focus not only on individual parameter values but on a combination of values because it potentially gives more insights into system behavior. Based on this, it is possible to find current problems and predict future ones.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">A person cannot cope with the calculations of such data arrays. That is why we need advanced analytics with machine learning capabilities to analyze historical data and find unusual patterns in real-time.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Now, we will show how to configure Trends Analytics for correct anomaly detection. However, before that, let’s consider what types of anomalies occur in Solar Farms.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="overview-of-common-anomalies-in-equipment-of-solar-power-plants">Overview of common anomalies in the equipment of solar power plants</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The most widespread and important problems for us are those with solar panels and inverters since these are the first frontier of obtaining energy. Therefore, we will look for anomalies in these parts of the power plant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="anomalies-in-photovoltaic-modules">Anomalies in photovoltaic modules</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Below, the most common breakdowns in PV modules and solar panels, which can be quickly and economically solved if they are dealt with immediately, will be described.<br><br>Most of them are formed on separate panels, so a drop in the indicators of one panel in contrast to another will indicate a breakdown. You can find each of them by finding anomalies in the Output Electricity (voltage and current) and Power Production indicators from the solar panel.</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Soiling:</strong> Soiling refers to the accumulation of dirt, dust, bird droppings, or other materials on the surface of solar panels. This layer of grime can significantly reduce the panels’ ability to absorb sunlight, leading to decreased electricity production.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Shading:</strong>&nbsp;Shading occurs when an object, such as a tree, building, or another solar panel, casts a shadow on a solar panel. This can lead to a reduction in the panel’s electricity production. Prolonged shadowing can lead to an imbalance in the solar panel system and may cause hot spots or reduce the overall lifespan of the panel.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Delamination and Internal Corrosion:</strong>&nbsp;Moisture can find its way into the panel, causing internal corrosion, if the panels are not keeping out air and water and all the solar panel components are not laminated correctly.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Identifying and Addressing Solar Panel Anomalies Faulty wiring, loose connections, corrosion, and oxidation can interfere with electricity production.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Hot Spots:</strong>&nbsp;Badly-soldered connections can cause low resistance in the part of the panel that receives the power generated by the cell, leading to a hotspot in the soldered points and/or a cell. This phenomenon can ultimately lead to a short circuit, reducing the performance and lifespan of the PV panel.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>PID Effect:</strong>&nbsp;Potential-induced degradation (PID) can cause an ongoing reduction in performance and accelerated aging of the PV panel. PID occurs when the voltage potential between the solar cells and the grounded frame of the panel causes a leakage current that can damage the cells.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Snail Trail Contamination:</strong>&nbsp;Snail trail contamination is a phenomenon where a white or grayish residue appears on the surface of the solar panel. This residue can reduce the performance of the panel and is caused by the release of silicone from the panel’s encapsulant material.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="tackling-anomalies-in-inverters">Tackling Anomalies in Inverters</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Inverters are a very important link of a solar power plant, a breakdown of which can lead to the shutdown of the entire power plant. This can have a critical impact on the total efficiency and profitability of the power plant.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">You can observe the operation of the inverter by following the indicators Output Voltage and Current, Frequency, Efficiency, and Temperature.</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Overheating:</strong>&nbsp;Inverters are sensitive to temperature, and high temperatures can reduce production and potentially a stoppage altogether if overheating occurs as the maximum operating temperature is reached. To prevent overheating, it is important to keep the switch cabinet and the area where the inverter is located well-ventilated, along with the inclusion of cleaning dust filters that can prevent any issues impeding airflow. You can monitor this problem with the help of indicators Temperature, Output Voltage, and Current.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Isolation Short-Circuit Fault:</strong>&nbsp;If there is too much moisture or damage to the cabling sleeves, then an isolation short-circuit fault can occur, whereby the inverter will report an “isolation alarm”. In this scenario, the solar inverter will either work at the minimum “required” isolation level or stop working altogether. You can monitor this problem with the help of indicators Efficiency, Output Voltage, and Current.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Inverter Does Not Restart:</strong>&nbsp;Inverters sometimes fail to restart after a power outage. Various factors, including a faulty inverter, a tripped circuit breaker, or a blown fuse, can cause this. You can monitor this problem with the help of indicators Frequency, and Efficiency.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Module:</strong>&nbsp;The MPPT module is responsible for tracking the maximum power point of the solar panel array. If the MPPT module fails, the inverter cannot convert the DC electricity generated by the solar panels into AC electricity. You can monitor this problem with the help of indicators Temperature, Output Voltage, and Current.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction">Introduction</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">For solar farms, dirty panels can mean thousands of dollars of lost revenue annually. Panels washed too early or too late – are costs that make up a serious portion of the power plant’s profitability.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">In one of our cases, we worked with a Spanish company, a producer of electricity. They owned a solar power plant with a capacity of 10 MW. They will produce about $260,000 worth of energy per month in ideal conditions. However, the company lost over a fifth of its energy due to soiling problems. In turn, the cost of the cleaning cycle was $50,000. Calculating the losses, it was clear that cleaning on a fixed schedule was showing poor results.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1024x574.webp" alt="Thingsboard dashboard with charts and lists solar panels statistics " class="wp-image-3758" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1024x574.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-300x168.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-768x430.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1536x861.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-2048x1148.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-512x287.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-920x516.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1600x897.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-1920x1076.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">To get the best possible results, you need to be sure of 3 steps:</p>



<ol>
<li style="font-size:16px">We have to find the energy losses</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">We need to know the forecast for electricity losses.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">You need to find the best time for the cleaning cycle.</li>
</ol>



<p style="font-size:16px">The key to solving all these questions is advanced analytics. A correctly configured system, like an expert, automatically decides what to do based on real-time and forecasted data and can manage the entire cleaning cycle, from collecting information to turning on the irrigation system or calling a group of cleaners without outside intervention.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Using IoT sensors to track real-time solar generation data, our solution provides actionable intelligence to optimize your cleaning schedule. Here’s how it works:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Sensors are installed to monitor energy production from individual panels. This allows precise tracking of solar output over time.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Advanced analytics calculate expected energy generation based on weather conditions and other variables. The difference between expected and available energy generation is considered energy loss.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Our algorithm evaluates the cost of cleaning against potential energy savings. It forecasts lost revenue accrued each day panels remain dirty.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">When the value of regained energy outweighs cleaning expenses, the system automatically alerts owners it’s time to wash or turn off/on the cleaning system.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Targeted cleanings restore generation at the optimal moment. You have the opportunity to adjust the cleaning schedule based on the economic feasibility of your decisions.</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Customers using our solar IoT solution have increased generation by 5-15% while reducing cleaning costs by up to 40%. Solar assets stay active at peak efficiency by timing cleanings precisely when needed.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="effective-solar-panel-cleaning-how-to-optimize-solar-panel-cleaning-schedule">Effective Solar Panel Cleaning. How to optimize Solar Panel cleaning schedule</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Our approach to solving this problem is based on Soiling cost calculation.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Soiling costs are the losses you will incur if you clean your station on this day. This indicator consists of&nbsp;<strong>the cost of cleaning</strong> for a 10 MW plant, which is approximately $50,000,&nbsp;<strong>the sum of all losses</strong>&nbsp;due to pollution, and all this is divided by the number of&nbsp;<strong>days</strong>&nbsp;since the last cleaning.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The indicator drops – good because our costs are decreasing. The indicator starts to rise – you need to wash the panels because the current costs are at their lowest point and then will constantly grow, and that is exactly the point when cleaning is economically feasible. As we can see in the table, in the dry period, when the loss indicators are only growing, the 5th week is the best time to carry out the cleaning cycle because compared to cleaning in any other week, the price is the lowest.</p>

</figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">That is why we need to set up an IoT system with advanced analytics to optimize the cleaning schedule based on the historical data from the solar plant, the production forecast, and the metrics we explained in this section.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="summary">Summary</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar power plants have many advantages, but due to their novelty, they also have many disadvantages. One of the most common is overspending based on pollution. This is a problem that cannot be eliminated, so the goal – is to minimize losses. Using IoT technologies and advanced analytics, you can easily monitor and wash solar panels at exactly the point in time when cleaning is economically feasible.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Analytics, IoT, and machine learning provide insights, risk forecasts, and data-driven decisions for better business performance. Embracing these ensures competitiveness and risk mitigation. Also, in the future, we plan to tell you how to improve the efficiency of the power plant by finding anomalies in the solar panels and parts of the power plant, such as the inverter or the battery. In our digital age, advanced analytics are the way to simplify and boost complex problem-solving!</p><p>The post <a href="/blog/reducing-costs-of-solar-farms-by-optimizing-the-cleaning-process/">Reducing costs of solar farms by optimizing the cleaning process</a> first appeared on <a href="/blog/">Thingsboard's blog</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:16px">Solar energy is becoming increasingly popular as the world looks to resolve the climate emergency and move toward a greener future. However, solar farms face several energy-generating challenges, including operating and maintenance costs, soiling, performance degradation over time, security and intrusion detection, optimizing energy output, and grid integration challenges.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">To address these issues, they increasingly rely on advanced analytics to optimize their operations, monitor weather conditions, and raise maintenance processes. Here, we’ll explore the main challenges faced by solar panels, as well as options for solving them with the help of advanced analytics.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Threshold business analytics approaches cannot deal with the complexity of solar power plant data and the problems that arise. Predictive maintenance, forecasting, and anomaly detection will be the main tools for solving challenges. Solar farms adopting such smart analytics tools have already seen benefits like 12-15% gains in annual energy yield, 15-20% drops in cleaning and maintenance costs, and 30% reductions in power output volatility. By leveraging these tools, solar farms can significantly increase their overall efficiency, reduce downtime, and lower their overall cost of operation.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The article aims to educate readers on the problems and the solutions to aid faster industry adoption of analytics. Continued efforts in this direction can help solar power advance strongly towards its promise of a brighter, cleaner energy future.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="solar-farm-structure">Solar Farm Structure</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar farms consist of solar panels, wires, inverters, batteries, and a utility meter. Due to the design features, each of these areas must be in constantly changing conditions, which causes many problems that require a quick solution.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-1024x574.webp" alt="Solar farm field with solar panels and different buildings" class="wp-image-3826" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-1024x574.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-300x168.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-768x430.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-1536x861.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-2048x1148.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-512x287.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-920x516.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-1600x897.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure-1920x1076.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solar-Farm-Structure.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">With the help of IoT technologies, we can take indicators that the analytics system can later store, process, and convert into previously unattainable parameters.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="understanding-the-difficulty-of-solving-challenges">Understanding the difficulty of solving challenges</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Before identifying the main challenges, it is important to understand their complexity and difficulty. We have identified 3 main causes for the decrease in overall efficiency:</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>The first</strong>&nbsp;is the large number of important metrics that need to be collected for analysis. A solar farm consists of hundreds or even thousands of devices. Each of the devices has a bunch of different parameters that are important for monitoring efficiency. No matter how much we reduce and simplify the system, even a 5 MWh system will have over 10,000 panels. The panels are connected to many inverters and batteries. And they, in turn, are connected by many connections. Accordingly, the system contains a huge amount of data, which is important to operate within a pile.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>The second</strong>&nbsp;is the instability of parameters due to changing weather conditions and the sensitivity of solar panels to external factors. This makes it impossible to identify patterns and set simple thresholds. A 15% drop in energy production may be due to a passing cloud rather than a breakdown, soiling, or misconfiguration. With parameters constantly shifting, spotting true problems becomes near impossible for standard threshold-based monitoring tools.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>The third</strong>&nbsp;is the inability of humans to process large amounts of data in real-time to take action to improve the situation. But quick action is essential to maximize productivity. So, the system requires machine intervention when it comes to large arrays of constantly changing indicators.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">However, a mature advanced analytics system contains built-in instruments that can help us solve the challenges described. Here are a few of them:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="561" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1024x561.webp" alt="Circulation of solar farm building challenges" class="wp-image-3828" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1024x561.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-300x164.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-768x421.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1536x842.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-2048x1122.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-512x281.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-920x504.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1600x877.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme-1920x1052.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scheme.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">So, advanced analytics can work with large amounts of data, find unusual patterns within it, and make the necessary decisions independently to achieve maximum efficiency.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Now that we understand the complexity of overcoming challenges and the tools that help solve them, we can proceed with a detailed overview of each challenge and possible solutions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-main-challenges-in-solar-farms">The main challenges in solar farms</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="operational-and-maintenance-costs">Operational and Maintenance Costs</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">One of the main challenges solar power plant owners face is the significant operation and maintenance costs associated with maintaining these facilities. The main reasons for high expenses are:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Replacement or maintenance of faulty components</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Panel cleaning</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Equipment wear and tear</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Labor costs</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar panels are sensitive to many environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, dust in the air, and other environmental indicators that accumulate over time. Not only do they reduce energy production efficiency, but they also require frequent maintenance and cleaning, which increases overall operating costs.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Here are the most common issues with solar plants that accumulate over time: Delamination and Internal Corrosion, Electrical Issues, Hot Spots, PID Effect, Snail Trail Contamination, Overheating, Isolation Short-Circuit Fault, Inverter Does Not Restart, and MPPT.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">If you want to learn more about this topic, see a full description of the problems and their solutions using anomaly detection, and check out the detailed step-by-step&nbsp;<a href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/optimizing-solar-parks-efficiency-advanced-anomaly-detection-solutions/" title="">guide here</a>.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Expenses such as these can account for up to 15-20% of the total annual cost of solar generation. Traditional maintenance practices often follow a fixed schedule, leading to inefficiencies, unnecessary downtime, and excessive operating costs.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar plant managers can use predictive analytics to foresee potential problems before they become costly downtime. This proactive approach minimizes the need for reactive or scheduled maintenance, optimizing the efficiency of the solar plant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="soiling">Soiling</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The accumulation of dust, dirt, grime, snow, sand deposits, and bird droppings on solar panels blocks incident sunlight to the cells and is a prime source of efficiency losses for solar farms.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Manual cleaning of soiled panels to restore generation is laborious and costly and only offers temporary respite against recurring soiling triggered by environmental or seasonal weather. The high frequency of cleaning needed for farms in specific locales also exponentially increases associated water usage and labor costs. Furthermore, traditional visual inspections for contamination suffer from inaccuracy due to limited manpower and subjective assessments that tend to underestimate early contamination.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Research shows soiling alone can lead to a staggering 7-30% decline in power generation for farms in deserts, near farms, highways, or colder regions. For instance, in some parts of the United States, the soiling rate can range from 0.03 to 0.15% per day, while in desert environments, the soiling loss can be as high as 0.5% per day. These generation gaps for solar farms with tens of thousands of panels placed in arrays covering different geographical regions lead to multimillion-dollar losses.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The way to solve soiling on solar farms with advanced analytics is to use forecasting and comprehensive calculation of the costs of soiling. By finding the perfect balance between the cost of cleaning and the prediction of pollution losses, the system based on real-time data can create a cost-effective cleaning schedule for specific areas.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">The system can provide a comprehensive report based on actual data, offering an overview of the solar farm’s condition and details about the optimal time for cleaning the solar panels. Additionally, the system can control the activation and deactivation of the nozzles or any other automated cleaning system at the most suitable time.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="performance-degradation-over-time">Performance degradation over time</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Another problem faced by solar power plant owners is the progressive degradation of generating capacity over the lifetime of a plant, which spans decades.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The long-term impact of natural factors, such as solar radiation, moisture, thermal cycles, and mechanical loads, leads to slow wear and tear of components over many years. Delamination, color change, hot spots, and microcracks in the panels lead to an annual drop in conversion efficiency and electrical output of 0.5-1%.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">For a 100 MWh solar power plant, over 25 years of operation, this steady degradation leads to a 10-20% net drop in electricity generation, which means millions in lost profits. Owners also face uncertainty in accurately predicting the degradation trajectories of equipment of different ages located at different sites. False estimates lead to revenue losses due to inaccurate power sales contracts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="643" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1024x643.webp" alt="Grid with solar farm statistics" class="wp-image-3852" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1024x643.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-300x188.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-768x482.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1536x964.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-2048x1285.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-512x321.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-920x577.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1600x1004.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map-1920x1205.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Heat-map.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Moreover, solar panels do not only degrade over time. The connection elements, inverters, batteries, and performance monitoring sensors lose effectiveness over time. It should also be noted that because the equipment is open to unplanned complete failure, solar farms may require short- and medium-term replacements.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">However, at the same time, we should keep in mind that electricity generation on solar farms is unstable. Therefore, it is not possible to tell the difference between changes in weather conditions and degradation by setting thresholds or simply looking at the indicators.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Advanced analytics allows us to identify long-term and short-term degradation, thus solving this problem. In addition, understanding when the best time to reinvest in equipment replacement is an advantage that will help you maintain the highest possible return on your investment over time.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The system constantly checks indicators from many parts of the solar power plant, making it possible to track the overall condition and degradation of individual areas. Not only is it possible to calculate, but accurate degradation monitoring will help avoid revenue losses caused by unpredictable degradation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-and-intrusion-detection">Security and Intrusion Detection</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar power plants are often located in remote locations and are large installations covering large areas. Therefore, expensive equipment such as inverters and solar panels face significant security and intrusion risks from external intruders. These risks can take many forms, causing huge financial and operational losses.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Theft and vandalism are common, with thieves attempting to steal valuable copper wiring and hackers tampering with energy infrastructure, causing power outages. Natural disasters such as forest fires, storms, and floods also create problems that threaten fencing, cables, and monitoring infrastructure. Additional risks, such as unauthorized access to control rooms or electrical sites through broken gates, also create security risks.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Without reliable monitoring tools, these threats often go undetected for long periods, allowing attackers to cause significant damage. Even traditional legacy security systems, such as motion detectors and surveillance cameras, have blind spots where cunning attackers can bypass detection. Patrolling security also offers inconsistent protection based on a large geography. The lack of real-time context also makes threat response ineffective.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Modern analytics platforms offer comprehensive coverage, analysis, and tools to protect solar power plants better. Sensor data analytics can dynamically monitor multi-factor threats. Algorithms can detect anomalies that indicate potential perimeter breaches. Smart cameras or drones can also detect intruder signals and send alerts to dispatchers faster. The information obtained from the cameras and drones can work in conjunction with other data from the solar farm, giving access to almost complete control over the security of the solar farm. Based on historical data from past interventions, you can build the best strategy to eliminate interference in the future.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="optimizing-energy-output">Optimizing Energy Output</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar power plants face the challenge of optimizing energy production due to inconsistent access to their main fuel &#8211; sunlight. The energy output changes during the day depending on the sun’s intensity and between days depending on the changing weather conditions.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Complex factors such as cloud cover, temperature, humidity, dust, and vegetation growth also dynamically affect the irradiance falling on the panels.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Starting with potential fines for under-delivery of electricity under power purchase agreements and ending with the impossibility of profitably participating in spot electricity markets based on the fact that there is too much energy to store in batteries of the available capacity. That is why it is important to use complex calculations and forecasts to find the projected energy production for the coming days.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">Advanced analytics allows you to detect generation problems by detecting anomalies or forecast problems by predicting them and triggering preventive, corrective actions to eliminate them. The analytical system can also analyze on a minute-by-minute basis whether it is better to take energy from batteries, solar panels, or the system, thus optimizing electricity bills. Such an automated system can significantly reduce electricity bills for households/factories and maximize profits for solar farms.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="grid-integration-challenge">Grid Integration Challenge</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The volatility of solar generation, which is dependent on weather conditions, creates significant challenges for grid integration. Solar energy production changes rapidly depending on cloud cover and time of day, causing voltage and frequency fluctuations for utilities if not appropriately handled. For grids with a high penetration of solar facilities, this variable generation, if increased, can challenge the stability and reliability of the grid.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">There are 3 types of system connection to the grid: distributed systems (off-grid), centralized energy (on-grid), and hybrid systems.</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Distributed generation is small solar photovoltaic panels (usually from 5 to 500 kilowatts) installed on residential or commercial properties, and solar panels satisfy the main demand for electricity.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Centralized generation is large centralized solar parks, usually with a capacity of hundreds of megawatts, which are connected to the power grid via high-voltage power lines. The main difference between off-grid and on-grid systems is that in centralized power generation, all the energy produced goes from the panels to an inverter, which is converted into alternating current and sent almost directly to the utility grid. In a distributed generation, the energy is stored in batteries and used by a residential or commercial facility as needed.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Hybrid generation differs because it contains batteries and can power a local building and connect to the utility grid.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:16px">Problems such as voltage spikes, protection discoordination, phase distortion, and unexpected voltage drops can occur when solar power exhibits instability and unpredictability.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Without effective climate change adaptation, problems range from nuisances like flickering lights to catastrophic large-scale blackouts due to cascading power line failures. The economic costs of unreliable renewable generation also reduce investor confidence in further expanding solar power to meet decarbonization goals.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Predictive forecasting combined with optimization for unexpected situations provides actionable information about the future variability of solar generation. Grid operators can take proactive steps to redirect generators, limit the capacity of solar power plants, or deploy batteries to smooth out fluctuations. Real-time anomaly detection also continuously monitors any new equipment limitations or stability risks.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Optimized algorithms prescribe ideal storage vs generation decisions hourly when combined with predictive modeling of dynamic electricity spot prices. Over a year, farms have achieved as much as 5-7% upside in annual revenues besides minimizing deviation penalties.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="first-steps-to-solving-problems">First steps to solving problems</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">We realized which problems occur in solar panels. We understood how to solve them with the help of advanced analytics. So finally, let’s define an action plan on how to make it happen with the help of the ThingsBoard IoT platform and Trendz for advanced analytics:</p>

</ul>
</li>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solar farms, due to their design factor, have a large number of challenges that require constant intervention and monitoring of the overall condition of the farm. The main challenges are operating and maintenance costs, soiling, performance degradation over time, security and intrusion detection, optimizing energy output, and grid integration challenges.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Effectively handling these challenges is the basis for the high efficiency of a solar farm.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">However, manual reading of indicators or setting thresholds is not enough for power plants with unstable energy production. Using advanced analytics will open up new horizons of efficiency and reliability for your solar farm.
