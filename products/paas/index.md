The **ThingsBoard Cloud** is a fully managed, scalable and fault-tolerant platform for your IoT applications.
ThingsBoard Cloud is for everyone who would like to use [ThingsBoard](/docs/getting-started-guides/what-is-thingsboard/) but don't want to host their own instance of the platform. 
As a platform user, you get a [tenant account](/docs/user-guide/entities-and-relations/) with certain entity and API [limits](/docs/user-guide/tenant-profiles/#entity-limits) 
that are defined based on the [subscription plan](/products/paas/subscription/).      

With **ThingsBoard Cloud** you get the following benefits:

 - **Advanced features.** Platform supports all [Professional Edition](/products/thingsboard-pe/) features and advanced [domain management](/products/paas/domains/).
 - **Improved time to market.** Save time on maintenance of the platform or configuration of the features.   
 - **Reduced costs.** The cost of the cluster infrastructure is shared between the users of the platform.
 - **High availability.** ThingsBoard Cloud uses microservices architecture and is deployed in multiple availability zones.
 - **Data durability.** Platform uses data replication and backup procedures to make sure you don't lose the data.
