* License & Usage Data: We collect information regarding the license keys you generate, unbundle, or delete. Additionally, via our automated license check mechanism, we collect technical data regarding your hosting environment and the specific version of the licensed product you are currently running.

**3. How We Use Your Information**

We use your data for the following purposes:
* Service Provision: To create your account and verify your identity.
* License Verification: To validate the status of your software licenses, ensure compliance with usage terms, and identify product versions for support or compatibility purposes.
* Transaction Processing: To facilitate the secure processing of payments through Stripe.
* Communication: To send you transaction confirmations, technical notices, and use for providing support.

**4. Data Sharing**

We do not sell your personal data. We may share your information only in the following circumstances:
* Payment Processors (Stripe): We integrate with Stripe to handle all billing and payment functions. Their use of your personal information is governed by their own Privacy Policy.
* Legal Compliance: If required by law, regulation, or legal process.

<br>

**5. Data Retention & Deletion**

* Retention: We retain your account and license history for as long as your account is active or as needed to comply with our legal obligations.
* Account Deletion: You may delete your user or company account at any time through the Portal settings. Upon deletion, your access to the Portal is removed.
