**Perpetual fallback licenses**  
 
License Server allows to purchase perpetual fallback licenses. 
A perpetual fallback license is a license that allows you to use a specific version of software without an active subscription for it. 
When purchasing perpetual fallback license, you get one year of software updates included to eternal usage of ThingsBoard PE. After the first year the customer can continue using the platform and purchase software updates for subsequent year for the discount fee.

Single perpetual fallback license covers single ThingsBoard PE instance (server process). 
So, if you like to run ThingsBoard PE in a HA mode, you will need at least two licenses. 

In order to purchase the Perpetual license the customer may register on License portal and then follow simple steps: 
- Go to ***Perpetual*** — ***Choose a product*** — Input ***Billing info*** — ***Create***

or choose exact product from [pricing](/pricing/). Once you press ***Get your license*** button you will be routed to the License portal authentication/registration or directly to ***Billing info*** step if you are already logged in on the License portal.
