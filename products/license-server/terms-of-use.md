<br>

**1. Introduction**

The ThingsBoard Licensing Portal (the "Portal"). By accessing or using this Portal to purchase and manage software licenses, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, please do not use the Portal.

<br>

**2. Account Registration & Data**

*Registration*: To access services, you must create a user account. You agree to provide accurate and complete information.

*Billing Details*: You are responsible for maintaining up-to-date billing information, including Company Name, Address, Tax ID, and Email. You represent that you have the authority to provide this information and bind the associated entity.

*Security*: You are responsible for safeguarding your login credentials. You are liable for all activities that occur under your account.

<br>

**3. License Management**

The Portal allows you to self-manage your ThingsBoard licenses. By using these features, you acknowledge:

*Purchases*: All license purchases are subject to the specific commercial terms agreed upon at checkout (e.g., pricing, duration).

*Key Management*: You are responsible for the actions taken within your account, including buying, unbundling, or deleting license keys.

*Irreversibility*: Please note that deleting a license key or unbundling licenses may be irreversible actions that affect your active software deployments.

<br>

**4. Termination & Account Deletion**

*User Deletion*: You may delete your individual user account or your company account at any time through the Portal interface.

*Effect of Deletion*: Deleting your account will remove your access to the Portal and may permanently remove associated data and purchase history as well as a whole company account. It does not absolve you of any outstanding financial obligations.

*Our Rights*: We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Portal if you violate these Terms or engage in fraudulent activity.

<br>

**5. Disclaimer & Liability**

The Portal is provided on an "as-is" basis. We make no warranties regarding the uninterrupted availability of the Portal. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect damages or loss of data resulting from your use of the Portal or the mismanagement of your license keys.

<br>

**6. Changes to Terms** 

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Portal following any changes signifies your acceptance of the modified Terms.
